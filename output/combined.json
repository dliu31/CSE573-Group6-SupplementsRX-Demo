        "query": "Calcium",
        "mechanism_of_action": "General\n\nThe bones and teeth contain greater than 99% of the calcium in the human body. Calcium in bone is present mainly as hydroxyapatite (1834). Calcium is also present in blood, extracellular fluid, muscle, and other tissues. It is essential for nerve transmission, muscle contraction, vascular contraction, vasodilation, glandular secretion, cell membrane and capillary permeability, enzyme reactions, respiration, renal function, and blood coagulation. It also plays a role in neurotransmitter and hormone release and storage, uptake and binding of amino acids, cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12) absorption, and gastrin secretion (15). Calcium in bone is a reserve source of calcium that can be mobilized to maintain extracellular calcium concentrations. About half of serum calcium is bound to plasma proteins. The free or ionized calcium is tightly regulated and is a useful clinical indicator of calcium status (1834).\n\nCalcium balance is generally positive during growth, neutral in the mature adult, and negative in older adults. Calcium is lost in varying amounts through the feces, urine, sweat, and sloughed skin cells. Reduced estrogen levels in women result in reduced calcium absorption and retention, increased bone turnover, and lower bone mass (1834, 8833, 8838, 8839).\n\nAntacid effects\n\nAs an antacid, calcium carbonate reacts with gastric hydrochloric acid. Calcium carbonate is the most potent antacid on a weight basis, followed by sodium bicarbonate (1843).\n\nAnti-cancer effects\n\nThere is interest in using calcium for cancer prevention. Preliminary evidence suggests calcium may have an antiproliferative effect on colorectal cancer cells (8820, 8870, 10019). Calcium taken orally also seems to reverse rectal epithelial hyperproliferation caused by excessive output of fecal bile acids and lipids after intestinal bypass (1826). However, population research suggests that serum calcium levels are not associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer (39014).\n\nAntidiabetes effects\n\nSome population research suggests that a higher intake of calcium from the diet or supplements, alone or in combination with vitamin D, is associated with a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to lower calcium intake (14265, 16713). The mechanism of action is not entirely clear. In patients without diabetes, calcium appears to improve insulin sensitivity (39363). Insulin secretion is dependent on calcium status, and vitamin D impacts the function of beta-cells by mediating calcium flux. Calcium and vitamin D may also improve glycemic control. A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that supplementing with calcium 1000 mg or more daily in conjunction with vitamin D 2000 IU or more daily can lower fasting blood glucose and reduce insulin levels and insulin resistance measured by Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) in patients without diabetes (100893).\n\nAntihypertensive effects\n\nEvidence suggests that inadequate dietary intake of calcium can play a role in the development of hypertension, stroke, and cardiovascular disease (8817, 39449). Calcium might lower blood pressure by increasing renal sodium excretion (12122). Animal research suggests that calcium can prevent salt-induced hypertension (39278). One clinical study in pregnant adults at risk for pre-eclampsia found that daily supplementation with calcium 1500 mg may lower some markers of inflammation such as interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, and interferon-gamma when compared with 500 mg daily, suggesting that calcium supplementation may reduce inflammation that could otherwise contribute to hypertension (113912).\n\nBone mineral density (BMD) effects\n\nIn human research, calcium appears to suppress biochemical markers of bone resorption (38721, 38949, 39257, 39406). However, this may not occur in individuals on bed rest (38996). Acute exercise increases bone resorption, which may be attenuated with pre-exercise intakes of calcium-rich foods (113935). One meta-analysis suggests that calcium fortification of food appears to have little overall effect on BMD in children and no effect on BMD in adults (107232). However, a meta-analysis of clinical trials in individuals under 35 years old shows that supplemental calcium increases BMD and bone mineral content when compared with control (113932). Additionally, clinical research in adolescents and young adults with perinatally acquired HIV shows that calcium and vitamin D supplementation may be beneficial for BMD and bone turnover markers (113916, 113936).\n\nCholesterol-lowering effects\n\nCalcium may help to lower serum cholesterol levels by forming insoluble complexes with saturated fatty acids in the gut, causing them to be excreted in the feces without being absorbed (2557).\n\nPremenstrual effects\n\nIn women, calcium levels may be lower during the premenstrual period due to effects of variations in estrogen levels on calcium absorption and metabolism. This may contribute to the mood changes and other symptoms associated with premenstrual syndrome (PMS) (2639, 6847).\n\nRenal effects\n\nCalcium is sometimes used for patients with renal disease because it can bind with phosphate in the gut, preventing its absorption and reducing the hyperphosphatemia associated with renal failure. Calcium carbonate and calcium acetate are used for this purpose. Calcium citrate is not recommended because it increases aluminum absorption. Conversely, hypophosphatemia causes an increase in intestinal calcium absorption and increased calcium in the blood, which can inhibit formation of new bone (3372, 8821), and potentially lead to a greater risk of renal calcium stone formation (3372).\n\nWeight loss effects\n\nIt is thought that calcium could modulate diet-related adiposity by inhibiting lipogenesis, increasing lipolysis, and promoting fat loss. This effect might be due to calcium suppression of calcitriol levels, which reduces intracellular calcium in adipose cells. This leads to reduced lipogenic gene expression and increased lipolysis, resulting in overall reduced adiposity (15397). Calcium seems to repartition dietary energy from adipose tissue to lean body mass (12119). Dairy products containing calcium seem to be more effective at regulating adiposity than elemental calcium supplements, which suggests that other active constituents in dairy play a role in fat tissue regulation (12121). However, most clinical research has found that increased calcium intake does not increase weight loss (12052, 13138, 15396, 15399, 38985, 39004, 97356). A meta-analysis of 20 clinical studies shows that daily dietary and supplemental calcium intake that meets the dietary reference intake (DRI) of 1000 mg or more daily does not increase weight loss in individual with overweight or obesity when compared with intake below the DRI (95813).\n\nWithdrawal effects\n\nThere is interest in using calcium to treat alcohol withdrawal symptoms. Some researchers have suggested that the calcium content of acamprosate, a medication approved for use in maintenance of abstinence from alcohol, may be the active component responsible for all or part of the efficacy of acamprosate. In addition, preliminary analyses suggest that alcohol cravings may be associated with serum calcium levels (107234)."

        "query": "Iron",
        "mechanism_of_action": "General\n\nIron is a trace mineral found in two ionic forms in the body. It exists in a reduced state as ferrous iron and in an oxidized state as ferric iron. Most of the iron in the body is found in the hemoglobin of red blood cells and in the myoglobin of muscle cells where it is required for oxygen and carbon dioxide transport (1093).\n\nIron also functions in the electron transport chain as an electron carrier in cytochromes. It is also found in the functional groups of most enzymes in the Krebs cycle (945). Iron is an essential cofactor in the synthesis of neurotransmitters such as dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin.\n\nMeats, such as red meat, poultry, and fish provide iron in heme and non-heme forms. Meats contain about 40% heme iron and 60% non-heme iron. Heme iron is absorbed at a rate of 23% compared to 2% to 20% for non-heme iron. Iron from plant sources is only in the non-heme form. Ascorbic acid and ferri-reductase in the duodenum aid in the absorption of non-heme iron. Iron bioavailability from a vegetarian diet is estimated to be 5% to 10%. Meats and fish seem to enhance the absorption of non-heme iron (7135).\n\nThe absorption of iron supplements may be increased by intermittent administration (1-3 doses/week) compared with daily administration. Intermittent administration is thought to align better with intestinal cell turnover, increasing absorption efficiency via increased exposure to new cells. This dosing strategy may also decrease oxidative stress and reduce adverse effects (103806).\n\nIron deficiency anemia in early life seems to negatively affect behavioral and neural development (1093, 9962). Signs and symptoms of deficiency include microcytic and hypochromic anemia, lethargy, cognitive impairment, developmental delay, amenorrhea, hair loss, enlarged liver, and others (7135). Iron deficiency in pregnancy has been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes and increased perinatal maternal mortality (7135).\n\nNeurological effects\n\nThere is interest in using iron to treat attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Research suggests that children with ADHD are more likely to be iron deficient. The level of iron deficiency seems to be positively correlated with the severity of ADHD symptoms. ADHD symptoms are related to dopamine dysfunction where iron seems to plays a role. Iron affects dopamine synthesis and appears to play a role in dopamine receptors density (10700).\n\nRespiratory effects\n\nThe cough induced by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may be linked to accumulation of nitric oxide. Since iron seems to reduce nitric oxide production, this effect might be clinically useful in the suppression of cough induced by ACE inhibitors (7307)."

        "query": "Magnesium",
        "mechanism_of_action": "General\n\nMagnesium (Mg) is a component of many compounds. It is the seventh most abundant element in the earth's crust by mass. It occurs in magnesite, dolomite, and in mineral waters (90051). Magnesium is well absorbed from foods (12587). Foods that are high in fiber are generally high in magnesium (13382). Dietary sources of magnesium include legumes, whole grains, vegetables (especially broccoli, squash, and green leafy vegetables), seeds, and nuts (especially almonds). Other sources include dairy products, meats, chocolate, and coffee. Water with a high mineral content, or \"hard\" water, is also a source of magnesium. Dietary intake of magnesium may be low, particularly among females (8088, 12504, 12505).\n\nAnalgesic effects\n\nMagnesium is reported to be an antagonist at N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, which are involved in the potentiation of pain. This effect and magnesium's depressant effects on nerves and smooth muscle are thought to contribute to the possible effects of magnesium in relieving symptoms associated with migraine headaches, postoperative pain, neuropathic pain, erythromelalgia, Raynaud's Phenomenon, and other vascular disorders and pain syndromes (6846, 6848, 8094).\n\nMagnesium might play a role in migraine headache. Low levels of magnesium may induce cerebral arterial vasoconstriction, increase platelet aggregation and promote serotonin release, and potentiate the vasoactive properties of serotonin (6844, 12388).\n\nAnti-inflammatory effects\n\nMagnesium deficiency has been reported to be a trigger for inflammatory processes. A meta-analysis of 17 clinical trials comparing the effects of various magnesium salts, 250-500 mg daily for 4-26 weeks, on inflammatory markers shows that magnesium significantly decreases serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and increases nitric oxide (NO) levels when compared with placebo. However, it does not affect levels of serum interleukin (IL)-6, total antioxidant capacity, glutathione (GSH), or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (108727).\n\nAntidiabetic effects\n\nThere is some evidence that magnesium plays a role in diabetes and metabolic syndrome (1168, 1183). In clinical research, oral magnesium has been reported to improve glycemic control in some patients with type 2 diabetes (1197, 15548, 60854, 61032, 96473). Low magnesium levels are associated with an increased risk of metabolic syndrome and obesity (13369, 13372, 105918). Poorly controlled diabetes can cause enhanced osmotic diuresis and increase urinary loss of magnesium (13381). In severe hyperglycemia, tubular reabsorption of magnesium is decreased and may result in lower magnesium levels secondary to increased excretion (13365). Autonomic neuropathy and related autoimmune gastric atrophy may reduce intestinal absorption of magnesium. Also, insulin can increase magnesium excretion (13381). However, in patients with reasonably well-controlled type 2 diabetes, dietary magnesium absorption and retention don't appear to be impaired. Lower serum levels may be related to lower dietary intake (13375). Magnesium seems to affect glucose control and insulin homeostasis. Magnesium blood levels might play a role in insulin resistance (1168, 6844, 14304, 17133). Insulin is involved with the shift of magnesium intracellularly. In turn, intracellular magnesium seems to regulate insulin activity on oxidative glucose metabolism. Low intracellular magnesium causes disorders in tyrosine kinase activity at the insulin receptor level, which results in decreased insulin sensitivity and insulin-mediated glucose uptake. Magnesium is also thought to enhance the action of enzymes involved in glucose utilization (13365, 17133).\n\nAntioxidant effects\n\nMagnesium has antioxidant effects that can be reduced by calcium (61106).\n\nCardiovascular effects\n\nMagnesium is known to be essential for all ATPase activity, including facilitating movement of calcium across and within the cell membrane of cardiac and vascular tissues (60920). In patients with congestive heart failure, there is evidence magnesium reduces coronary vascular resistance, increases coronary artery blood flow, has antiarrhythmic effects, and improves cardiac indexes (8088).\n\nThere is interest in using magnesium for preventing endothelial function decline, which is a risk factor for cardiovascular events. A meta-analysis of preliminary clinical research suggests that taking magnesium for at least 6 months improves endothelial function as measured by flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) in patients who are unhealthy, over 50 years of age, or overweight (102455). There is also interest in the effects of magnesium on arterial stiffness, which is a predictor of coronary heart disease and stroke. In overweight adults, taking magnesium 450 mg daily as the citrate, oxide, or sulfate salts for 24 weeks does not affect arterial stiffness, measured by the carotid-to-femoral pulse wave velocity, when compared with placebo (108730).\n\nThere is some evidence that magnesium is important in regulating blood pressure (1170, 1182). Magnesium deficiency has been found to increase intracellular concentrations of sodium and potassium, which can lead to increased peripheral resistance and vasospasm (8088). In cell membranes, a decreased concentration of magnesium and increased calcium to magnesium ratio has also been associated with hypertension (8092). There is also some evidence that hypertensive patients with hypomagnesemia usually require more antihypertensive medications than hypertensive patients with normal magnesium levels (8088).\n\nReduced intracellular magnesium also causes an increase in intracellular calcium. In addition to contributing to insulin resistance, higher intracellular calcium levels enhance calcium-mediated vasoconstriction, and inhibit cardiac and smooth muscle relaxation (13365). This increased vascular tone can increase blood pressure.\n\nThere is some evidence that serum magnesium deficiency might play a role in both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke (8998).\n\nDeficiency\n\nMagnesium deficiency is not uncommon in the US. It's particularly prevalent among African Americans and the elderly. Low intake and impaired absorption of magnesium have also been associated with the development of various disease states such as osteoporosis, hypertension, atherosclerotic vascular disease, cardiomyopathy, diabetes, and stroke (8088, 8099, 8998, 9001, 12510, 12511). Hypomagnesemia is usually asymptomatic. The serum magnesium level is the most commonly used test to assess magnesium status. However, it is also known that the serum magnesium level is depressed only in cases of severe magnesium deficiency and that it poorly correlates with body magnesium (8089). The body preserves serum magnesium at the expense of magnesium in cells and bone, so serum levels may appear normal in magnesium deficiency (12510, 12511). Red cell and urine magnesium levels also have been used but they are also poor indicators of body magnesium (8085, 8089). The intravenous magnesium loading test is considered to be a more reliable test to measure magnesium status. However, the test is cumbersome and requires full participation from the patient. It is known that serum magnesium actually consists of three fractions. They are protein-bound, complexed, and free ionic magnesium. It is the free ionic magnesium that is biologically active. Whether the serum magnesium level is low or normal, free ionic magnesium levels have been shown to vary with many disorders such as cardiac disease, stroke, diabetes, and migraines. In recent years, instruments have become available that measure free ionic magnesium, allowing for a more accurate assessment of body magnesium. However, measurement of ionized magnesium may not be readily available in labs outside the research setting (8090).\n\nSymptoms of severe magnesium deficiency include convulsions; confusion; muscle weakness; abnormal muscle movements such as tremors, myoclonus, and tetany; and arrhythmias including ventricular tachycardia, fibrillation, and torsades de pointes (403, 13383). Long-term magnesium deficiency might increase the risk of arrhythmias and the rate of developing atherosclerosis (13383).\n\nGastrointestinal\n\nAs antacids, magnesium salts work by reacting with gastric acid to form magnesium chloride. Magnesium hydroxide has the fastest onset of action, magnesium carbonate is slower due to its crystal structure, and magnesium trisilicate has the slowest onset and longest duration due to its poor solubility (6844).\n\nThe laxative effects and diarrhea produced by magnesium salts are due to the osmotic effects of unabsorbed salts in the intestine and colon, and stimulation of gastric motility due to the release of gastrin and cholecystokinin (6844).\n\nHormonal effects\n\nIntracellular levels of magnesium, measured in erythrocytes and leukocytes, have been found to be lower in females with premenstrual syndrome (PMS), leading to the use of magnesium supplements for PMS (6847). Oral magnesium has been reported to benefit mood changes associated with premenstrual syndrome (PMS) (1187).\n\nSupplementation of thyroid hormone to hypothyroid animals restored magnesium levels and transport. Therefore, thyroid hormones may have an effect on magnesium homeostasis (60899).\n\nImmune effects\n\nIn clinical research, magnesium has been shown to decrease plasma cortisol levels (2826). Additional research suggests low serum magnesium is related to low-grade chronic inflammation. Hypomagnesemia is associated with elevated serum concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and C-reactive protein (CRP), which has been linked to metabolic syndrome (13366). Magnesium intake inversely correlates with CRP levels: females with high dietary magnesium intake have lower levels of CRP, which may reduce cardiovascular disease risk. The relationship is strongest in overweight or obese females (BMI >25) and current or past smokers (13369). Other epidemiological research in adults has found that consuming less that the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for magnesium is associated with a 1.48 to 1.75 times higher risk of having an elevated CRP. In adults over age 40 with a BMI >25, consumption of less than 50% of the RDA for magnesium correlates with a 2.24 times higher risk of elevated CRP (13371, 13373). However, it is unclear if magnesium supplementation reduces CRP levels. One meta-analysis of 18 clinical trials including 927 patients with various conditions shows that supplemental magnesium does not reduce CRP levels when compared with placebo (105921). The included studies were not designed to assess CRP levels or baseline magnesium status, limiting the validity of this finding.\n\nMuscular effects\n\nExtracellular magnesium is critical to both maintaining nerve and muscle electrical potentials and transmitting impulses across neuromuscular junctions (272). The inhibitory effect of magnesium on preterm labor contractions (tocolysis) is attributed to antagonism of calcium-mediated myometrial contractions (6844). Oral magnesium has been reported to reduce the incidence of pregnancy-related leg cramps which may be associated with lower serum magnesium levels (1194). Magnesium was also found to be effective in preventing succinylcholine-induced muscle twitching, which is an adverse effect of patients undergoing general anesthesia (60834).\n\nNeurological effects\n\nExtracellular magnesium is critical to both maintaining nerve and muscle electrical potentials and transmitting impulses across neuromuscular junctions (272). Preliminary evidence shows magnesium may act as a neuroprotective agent in patients diagnosed with acute stroke. Several possible mechanisms of neuroprotection exist, including noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonism and calcium channel antagonism (9000, 9003).Magnesium levels also appear to be lower in acute attacks of paranoid schizophrenia (12584).\n\nIn animal research, magnesium has been shown to have neuroprotective effects (60986). It was shown to prevent post-hypoxic brain injury by blocking the excess release of glutamate in the calcium channel. Fetal and newborn brains appear to be more susceptible to damage from glutamate release; therefore, blocking glutamate receptors through agents such as magnesium may reduce the risk of injury in the perinatal period. However, clinical studies to date have not shown a definite fetal neuroprotective benefit from prenatal administration of magnesium to pregnant patients, although prenatal magnesium therapy may improve motor function in early childhood for infants born prematurely (114681).\n\nThe role of magnesium in the prevention or control of convulsions may involve blocking neuromuscular transmission and decreasing the release of acetylcholine at the motor nerve terminals (61006).\n\nThe mechanism of action for magnesium in pre-eclampsia and eclampsia is not clear. There is some evidence that magnesium dilates blood vessels in the central nervous system (CNS) to reduce ischemia. Contrary to this view are indications that magnesium may decrease CNS blood flow (9473). Additionally, magnesium may have anticonvulsant actions in eclampsia due to depression of neuromuscular transmission, direct depressant effect on smooth muscle, and CNS depression (6844).\n\nThere is interest in using magnesium for improving symptoms of insomnia and other sleep disturbances. In a small clinical study in elderly patients with primary insomnia, magnesium intake increased levels of melatonin and reduced levels of cortisol, which might contribute to improved sleep (102458). Additionally, low magnesium levels have been linked to poor sleep quality and also to electroencephalogram (EEG) abnormalities during slow wave sleep. Magnesium has been theorized to regulate sleep by reducing inflammation, oxidative stress and by activating N-methyl-D-aspartate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors (102456).\n\nOtic effects\n\nOral magnesium treatment has been shown to reduce the incidence of temporary and permanent noise-induced hearing loss. It is hypothesized that magnesium may improve permanent hearing threshold shifts (NIPTS) (1205, 60813).\n\nPulmonary\n\nIn asthma, intravenous administration of magnesium might cause bronchodilation (2003, 60889).\n\nRenal effects\n\nThere is some evidence that magnesium metabolism is a factor in renal stone formation and prevention (2006, 2007). There is preliminary evidence that magnesium can reduce hypertension and nephrotoxicity induced by cyclosporine. Magnesium supplementation appears to reduce the thickening of the renal vascular walls that may occur with cyclosporine therapy; potassium supplementation may increase the effectiveness of magnesium for this use (9500).\n\nSkeletal effects\n\nMagnesium is important for normal bone structure (272), and plays an essential role in more than 300 cellular reactions (945). Magnesium is required for the formation of cyclic AMP (cAMP) and is involved in ion movements across cell membranes (945). It is involved in protein synthesis and carbohydrate metabolism (272).\n\nMagnesium deficiency increases the formation and activity of osteoclasts (bone resorbing cells). Magnesium deficiency causes increases in substance P and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in bone, which increase osteoclastic bone resorption. Increased bone resorption causes release of magnesium as well as calcium from bone. Since magnesium is an essential nutrient, the body may sacrifice bone in times of deficiency as a magnesium source to maintain homeostasis (12499, 12500). Magnesium deficiency might be a risk factor for postmenopausal osteoporosis, but its exact role is unknown (7555).\n\nMagnesium, like calcium, is regulated by parathyroid hormone (PTH). In humans, severe to moderate magnesium deficiency commonly causes hypocalcemia. Normally, magnesium deficiency increases PTH activity. PTH increases renal calcium reabsorption, increases phosphate excretion, and increases renal magnesium reabsorption. Impaired parathyroid hormone (PTH) activity and impaired response to PTH seem to be the predominant reasons that magnesium-deficient people are also hypocalcemic (12499). However, clinical research shows that magnesium sulfate 350 mg taken daily by mouth for 3 weeks does not affect calcium blood levels in patients with hypoparathyroidism taking maintenance therapy of calcium and a vitamin D analog (90010).\n\nClinical research suggests that magnesium, alone or in combination with calcium, vitamin D, and zinc, reduces bone turnover (60928, 60934, 60950). In combination with calcium, vitamin D, and other minerals, magnesium increases bone density (36840). Magnesium supplementation in postmenopausal patients with osteoporosis results in decreased serum iPTH and urinary deoxypyridinoline and increased serum osteocalcin (60928, 60950)."

        "query": "Selenium",
        "mechanism_of_action": "General\n\nSelenium is a metallic substance that is available in a variety of chemical compounds. Often selenium is attached to an organic molecule as in selenocysteine, selenomethionine, and kappa-selenocarrageenan. In broccoli, garlic, onions, and other selenium-accumulating plants it is found as Se-methylselenocysteine or selenocystathionine (7833, 7836). In dietary supplements selenium is commonly provided as selenomethionine or in a selenite or selenate salt form (7841). Often selenium is given as selenized yeast, which is common brewer's yeast that has been grown in selenium-rich media (7838). After ingestion as a selenate salt, selenite salt, or as one of the organic forms, selenium must be reduced or metabolized to form hydrogen selenide, an important intermediary form. Selenide is essential for the activity of selenoproteins, such as the glutathione peroxidase enzyme (GSH-Px). The primary organic forms of selenium are the amino acid-based selenocysteine and selenomethionine. Selenomethionine is incorporated directly into proteins, because RNA does not differentiate it from methionine (7832, 9718). Selenomethionine serves as a storage form, releasing selenium as the proteins containing it are catabolized (7834, 9718).\n\nAntineoplastic effects\n\nSelenium appears to increase cancer cell death by causing apoptosis and by reducing the formation of ROS. The magnitude of the anticancer effects vary substantially among selenium compounds. Selenite has a high potential to cause apoptosis and selenocystamine is lower. Kappa-selenocarrageenan also has the ability to induce apoptosis. Selenomethionine has almost no effect on apoptosis (7827, 7828). Se-methylselenocysteine found in broccoli, garlic, and onions may be better than supplemental selenite in preventing colonic cancer (7833). Epidemiological evidence indicates that lower blood selenium concentrations increases the likelihood of prostate cancer (8734, 8735, 8736). Higher levels of selenium may slow prostate cancer tumor progression (13257). Selenium seems to accumulate in the prostate, and protect against DNA damage and increase apoptosis in cancer cells (13258). Lower selenium blood concentrations have also been associated with colorectal cancer (9726). However, early data suggests that there may be more effective and less toxic forms of organic selenium, for preventing colorectal cancer, than those used previously (9737). Preliminary data suggest that supplementing the diet with selenium can reduce the risk for developing breast cancer, but no benefit has been shown in humans (9690, 9723). The urinary excretion of selenium is increased during cervical cancer, but the clinical significance of this observation is not known (9727).\n\nAnimal research shows that selenium administration might inhibit the development of carboplatin resistance. In mice with ovarian cancer, administration of high doses of sodium selenite prior to administration of carboplatin prevents the development of resistance. Similarly, pre-treatment of tumors with sodium selenite prior to implantation into the mice also prevents the development of resistance to carboplatin (99660).\n\nAntioxidant effects\n\nAt plasma concentrations below 1000 mcg/L, selenium activates glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), which reduces oxidative stress by handling free radicals and hydrogen peroxide. At concentrations above 2000 mcg/L selenium paradoxically increases cellular oxidation by promoting the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as hydroxyl free radicals and superoxide. At higher concentrations selenium also promotes the intracellular formation of nitric oxide, which is converted to toxic nitrous oxide (2664, 7825, 7826, 7827, 7828, 7829). To reduce the effect of ROS formation, selenium is often given with other antioxidants, such as vitamin E or vitamin C. Preliminary evidence suggest selenium and vitamin E act synergistically as antioxidants, and may also synergistically inhibit prostate cancer cell growth (11682, 14526). Some data suggest that vitamin E reduces toxicity associated with excessive selenium intake (11683), but a cell culture study found that vitamin E increased the cytotoxic effects of high selenium levels (7841). Conversely, vitamin C appears to reduce the cytotoxicity of selenium (7841).\n\nSelenium is used for arthritis due to its antioxidant effects. It may reduce inflammation by reducing the cellular concentration of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (2662). In liver transplant, ROS are generated when the organ is re-perfused with blood following a period of extended warm ischemia. Preliminary evidence suggests that the antioxidant action of selenium can decrease liver damage and improve microcirculation (7839). Selenium may act as part of a defense mechanism, decreasing oxidative stress in peptic ulcer disease (7840).\n\nBone effects\n\nThere is interest in using selenium supplementation to promote bone health, since epidemiologic data has associated higher selenium blood levels with higher bone mineral density and improved bone turnover markers. However, a large clinical study in adults aged 60 to 74 years, most of which had adequate selenium levels at baseline, shows that taking selenium-enriched yeast 100-300 mcg daily for 5 years does not improve markers of bone turnover when compared with baseline (110592).\n\nCardiovascular effects\n\nIn cardiovascular disease, selenium may prevent the oxidative modification of low-density lipoproteins (LDLs). Selenium deficiency has been implicated in the etiology of Keshan disease, an endemic cardiomyopathy observed in China, and congestive cardiomyopathy in people on artificial nutrition (2676, 3341). In children with severe deficiency, Keshan disease may also occur (9718). Research in adults with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) shows that selenium supplementation upregulates gene expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma), which is implicated in several metabolic pathways including lipid and insulin metabolism. Additionally, selenium upregulates gene expression of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1), which is implicated in glucose transport across membranes, and downregulates expression of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), which is integral in cholesterol transport and subsequent development of atherosclerosis (113656).\n\nFertility effects\n\nSelenium is required for testosterone biosynthesis and the formation and development of sperm. At least 25 selenoproteins help maintain the cellular integrity of sperm (102968). Low selenium levels have been linked to decreased male fertility.\n\nSelenium also might be implicated in female fertility. Low selenium levels appear to be associated with first trimester or recurrent miscarriages, suggesting selenium possibly prevents early pregnancy loss (3341). During pregnancy, the concentration of selenium in blood usually increases. Supplementing the diet with low doses of iron seems to prevent this increase (10217).\n\nResearch in adults with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) shows that selenium supplementation downregulates gene expression of inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, both of which are implicated in oocyte fertilization and pregnancy outcomes. Additionally, selenium supplementation upregulates gene expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma), which are associated with embryo quality and the regulation of several metabolic pathways, steroidogenesis, and ovarian function (113640, 113656).\n\nGenetic effects\n\nA small clinical study in pregnant patients with gestational diabetes mellitus shows that taking selenium 200 mcg daily for 8 weeks increases genetic expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-y) and glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1) when compared with placebo. Selenium did not seem to affect expression of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and lipoprotein(a) (104419).\n\nHormonal effects\n\nSelenium plays a major role in the synthesis and metabolism of thyroid hormones. The thyroid gland has a higher concentration of selenium than any other organ in the body. Selenium is an essential component of the enzyme iodothyronine deiodinase which converts thyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3) (1665, 9724). In iodine-deficient people, selenium deficiency can exacerbate hypothyroidism (1664, 9724). However, giving selenium alone in this situation can further exacerbate the hypothyroidism because the conversion of T4 to T3 is increased, while the thyroid gland lacks iodine to synthesize more T4 (1664, 14563, 14564, 14565). Selenium may also be able to prevent alterations in thyroid hormone levels that are sometimes observed in patients after trauma (9725).\n\nSelenium is also of interest for other hormonal effects. In patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), taking selenium 200 mcg daily for 12 weeks seems to reduce levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and testosterone, which suggests improved outcomes in this patient population (104423). Animal research suggests that selenium might stabilize the expression off genes associated with the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt) pathway, which is normally suppressed in PCOS with insulin resistance. Researchers theorize that the PI3K/Akt pathway is implicated in insulin signaling and has a significant downstream role in ovarian follicular granulosa cell growth and development (113650).\n\nImmune system effects\n\nSelenium improves immunologic function by increasing the activity of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and promoting the normal growth and development of T helper cells. These actions may be important in treating acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) because selenium deficiency is common in this condition (7829). There is preliminary experimental evidence that selenium inhibits reverse transcriptase and replication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). However, there is also some evidence that selenium may improve subjective feelings of well-being in patients infected with HIV, but it does not appear to affect overall outcomes (3341, 7830, 9719). Selenium deficiency is associated with increased viral shedding in women infected with HIV. Supplementing the diet of these women with selenium may decrease the transmission of AIDS (9720). There is also evidence that suggests that deficiency of selenium may increase inflammatory lung damage caused during influenza virus infection (9728). Selenium also might protect patients infected with hepatitis B or C from developing liver cancer (3341).\n\nDespite limited evidence that selenium could support immune function, a meta-analysis of clinical studies in healthy adults shows that supplementation with selenium for 8 to 48 weeks might modestly benefit natural killer (NK) lysis activity but does not affect immunoglobulin (Ig), white blood cell, or cytokine concentrations, including IgA, IgG, IgM, lymphocytes, B-cells, T-cells, T helper CD4+ cells, T cytotoxic CD8+ cells, natural killer (NK) cells, interleukin-10, interferon-gamma, or interleukin-2. However, dose-response analysis suggests that there might be modest immunologic benefits in those with low selenium status at baseline, but those benefits become null or adverse after selenium intake exceeded 70 mcg daily (113639).\n\nNeurologic effects\n\nThere is interest in whether selenium can slow or reverse degenerative neurological diseases such as Alzheimer disease and other dementias by reducing oxidative stress. Some observational research found that certain brain regions of patients with Alzheimer disease have lower levels of selenium when compared with control brains. This suggests increased oxidative stress-mediated neurodegeneration in the brain of these patients (101344). A meta-analysis of 3 small studies in patients with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer disease shows that taking selenium as a supplement or as a daily Brazil nut for 12-24 weeks may improve markers of oxidative stress (i.e. plasma malondialdehyde levels) when compared with baseline (110594). However, observational research failed to find reduced risk of dementia after selenium supplementation (93570). This research was limited due to its short duration and imperfect screening methods (93570, 93571).\n\nThere is also research into ingestion of the inorganic form of selenium, selenate. A very small clinical study in adults with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease shows that taking high dose sodium selenate may slow white matter atrophy in the human brain (113658).\n\nPsychological effects\n\nLow levels of selenium appear to be associated with a greater incidence of depression, anxiety, confusion, and hostility. Some researchers think a high dietary or supplemental intake of selenium might improve mood (3341)."

        "query": "Vitamin A",
        "mechanism_of_action": "General\n\nVitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin. Vitamin A includes a family of molecules containing a 20-carbon structure with various chemical groups at the 15 carbon position. Variations at the 15 carbon position yield different vitamin A forms, including retinol, retinal, retinoic acid, and retinyl ester. These different forms of vitamin A are often collectively referred to as \"retinoids.\" The most potent form of vitamin A, all-trans retinol, is the form of retinol in the diet. It reverses signs and symptoms of vitamin A deficiency and is the standard for vitamin A activity (9191). The vitamin A family also includes provitamin A carotenoids, which are dietary precursors to retinol.\n\nVitamin A is found in foods in several forms. Retinol, also called preformed vitamin A, is present in esterified form in animal-derived products including fish and animal liver, eggs, whole milk, butter, fortified margarine, meat, and oily saltwater fish (7135). Animal liver contains the highest amount of dietary retinol. About two-thirds of vitamin A intake comes from dietary retinol (9189). Fresh water fish contain a form of vitamin A called 3-dehydroretinol, but have only 30% to 40% of the biologic activity of retinol (15). About a third of dietary vitamin A comes from plants, which synthesize carotenoids that are converted to vitamin A in the body (7135). Carotenoid pigments (including alpha-, beta-, and gamma-carotene and cryptoxanthin) are present in grains, oils, green and yellow vegetables, and especially in carrots and fruits (8044). The amount of carotenoids absorbed and converted to vitamin A depends upon the amount of carotenoids ingested, the individual's vitamin A status, and carotenoid body stores (8044).\n\nVitamin A is required for vision, growth and bone development, reproduction, cell proliferation and differentiation, immune function, and the integrity of mucosal and epithelial surfaces. All-trans retinol is converted in the body to all-trans retinoic acid by an unknown mechanism. All-trans retinoic acid is the active form of vitamin A in almost all biological processes. Retinoic acid regulates the expression of various genes that encode for structural proteins, such as keratins in the skin; enzymes, such as alcohol dehydrogenase; extracellular matrix proteins, such as the basement membrane protein laminin; and retinol binding proteins and receptors (7135, 9189, 95051). Vitamin A also regulates genes, including those of the dopaminergic system, in the brain and central nervous system (91164). Vitamin A acts as a cofactor in mucopolysaccharide synthesis, cholesterol synthesis, hydroxysteroid metabolism, and glycoprotein glycosylation (15).\n\nAnti-cancer effects\n\nIn vitro studies suggest that retinoids might help prevent cancer by inducing tumor suppressor genes known as retinoic acid receptors (RAR). Tumor suppressor gene RAR-beta2 is absent in many malignant tumor cells, possibly due to methylation of the gene. When demethylated, the RAR-beta2 gene can be induced by retinoic acid to function and suppress growth of cancer cells (6380, 6381). However, there is evidence that some forms of retinoic acid, such as all-trans-retinoic acid, do not use the RAR receptor to inhibit cancer growth and may use other mechanisms and pathways to inhibit growth (8045). There is also evidence that the inhibitory effect on cancer cell growth by certain statin drugs with a closed ring structure, such as mevastatin and lovastatin (Mevacor), may be enhanced when used with 13-cis retinoic acid (8046). Ethanol may compete with retinol for alcohol dehydrogenase and inhibit retinoic acid synthesis, interfering with normal retinoid signaling of RAR genes and cause malignant transformation of hepatic cells (6377). Preliminary evidence suggests that all-trans-retinoic acid applied topically might help protect the skin against UV radiation damage. UV radiation seems to cause a functional vitamin A deficiency in the skin (1468). Vitamin A acts an antioxidant, and may play a role in free radical scavenging, decreasing oxidative stress, and stimulating immune function in cancer (95060).\n\nAnti-inflammatory effects\n\nVitamin A seems to have both anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory effects. In humans, vitamin A supplementation increases levels of C-reactive protein (CRP). However, vitamin A supplementation does not affect blood levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) or interleukin (IL)-6 (109746) in some studies, while in other studies it lowers IL-6 and IL-8 (114498).\n\nBone effects\n\nBoth human and animal studies suggest excessive vitamin A intake can have a negative effect on bone (7712, 9190, 9191, 9192). Retinoic acid receptors are found on osteoblasts and osteoclasts (95051). Vitamin A seems to suppress osteoblast activity, stimulate osteoclast formation, and antagonize the ability of vitamin D to maintain normal serum calcium levels (7712, 9190, 9191, 9192). Some evidence suggests that older people can't metabolize vitamin A as well younger people, which could increase the risk of osteoporosis (9191).\n\nConcurrent effects of vitamin E\n\nBased on cell culture and animal studies, it's been suggested that vitamin E affects the activity of vitamin A. These include preventing oxidation in the gut and increasing absorption, enhancing utilization, promoting liver storage, protecting against cell damage caused by high vitamin A levels, and reducing some of the symptoms of hypervitaminosis A (10545, 10557, 10558, 10560). Supportive data in humans is very limited. There is some preliminary evidence that vitamin E increases the effects of vitamin A in the treatment of some skin conditions (10562). Small studies have reported increased vitamin A absorption and excretion, and both increases and decreases in vitamin A levels when vitamin E is taken concurrently (10559, 10561, 10563, 10564). Despite the lack of good evidence of efficacy or necessity, vitamin E has been added to the intermittent, high doses of vitamin A sometimes used to treat deficiency in developing countries (10558, 10560). Further research is needed to determine whether vitamin E affects the activity of vitamin A in humans.\n\nDermatologic effects\n\nVitamin A deficiency is associated with follicular hyperkeratosis (7135). Topically, retinoids are used to reduce inflammation and to normalize follicular keratinocyte differentiation (82576).\n\nEmbryonic development\n\nIn embryonic development, vitamin A plays an important role in neural development, and is also involved in the development of the limbs, lung, heart, eyes, and ears (7135, 11978). However, excessive vitamin A is teratogenic, causing central nervous system, craniofacial, cardiovascular, and thymus malformations (11978).\n\nHematologic effects\n\nVitamin A is important for the normal utilization of iron and prevention of anemia. Deficiency of vitamin A impairs maturation of hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow. Vitamin A may facilitate mobilization of body stores of iron. Preliminary evidence also indicates that vitamin A and beta-carotene enhance non-heme iron absorption from iron-fortified wheat and corn flour, and rice. In addition, vitamin A appears to be involved with production of erythropoietin by the liver and kidney (9518, 9569, 9586, 95057).\n\nImmunologic effects\n\nVitamin A is important for immune function. Retinoic acid is required in maintaining sufficient levels of natural killer cells, and preliminary evidence suggests that retinoic acid might increase the production of cytokines, such as interleukin 1 (IL-1). Additionally, B lymphocyte growth, differentiation, and activation are dependent on retinol (7135). Vitamin A deficiency is associated with increased risk of infectious morbidity and mortality (7135). Some research has linked retinol deficiency to development of cervical neoplasms in adults with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (9800).\n\nVitamin A deficiency seems to adversely affect fetal immune status. Maternal-fetal transmission of HIV is higher in the presence of low vitamin A status (11978). However, vitamin A supplementation during pregnancy does not appear to affect the rate of mother-to-child transmission of HIV in mothers positive for HIV not currently on anti-retroviral therapy (95059). Other research shows that supplementing pregnant adults with vitamin A 10,000 IU daily, starting prior to the administration of the H1N1 influenza vaccination and continuing for 6 months postpartum, increases H1N1 immunity titers in mothers, but not in their infants (100328).\n\nNeurologic effects\n\nThere is interest in using vitamin A for complications of multiple sclerosis (MS). Certain complications such as fatigue and depression may be secondary to inflammation. Retinoic acids may suppress the proliferation of pathogenic T cells that are present in MS and may increase production of regulatory cells that modulate the immune system. Retinoic acids have been shown to stimulate anti-inflammatory effects, downregulate gene expression of inflammatory cytokines, change levels of retinoic acid receptors found on mononuclear cells, and shift the Th1/Th2 balance towards Th2, which secretes anti-inflammatory cytokines. Lastly, retinoic acids may also lead to neuroregeneration (95052). In addition to fatigue, inflammatory products also lead to changes in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in neurons, which could further contribute to depression (95052).\n\nOcular effects\n\nVitamin A is necessary for the maintenance of the epithelium of the conjunctiva and cornea. It's also necessary for epithelial RNA synthesis (95058). In the retina, retinol is converted to cis-retinal, which combines with opsin to form rhodopsin, the visual pigment. Retinal is required by the eye for the transduction of light into the neural signals that produce vision. The most specific indicator of vitamin A deficiency is xerophthalmia, which is initially manifested by night blindness that progresses to complete visual loss if untreated (7135, 95058).\n\nPulmonary effects\n\nVitamin A is necessary for normal lung growth and function of respiratory tract cells (95053). Retinol seems to affect pulmonary function. Higher retinol levels have been associated with higher forced expiratory volume (FEV) and forced vital capacity (FVC) (9195). In animal research, vitamin A increases surfactant production in the lungs and increases alveolarization (90778). A fetus accumulates vitamin A during the 3rd trimester. As such, preterm infants have decreased levels of vitamin A at birth, which increases the risk of developing chronic lung disease (95053).\n\nToxic effects\n\nVitamin A toxicity can occur when vitamin A intake exceeds the storage capacity of the liver or when liver function is compromised. Vitamin A is released into the circulation as retinyl esters rather than bound to retinol-binding protein (RBP). The retinyl esters expose target tissues to free retinol, resulting in the damaging effects of hypervitaminosis A (9196).\n\nWound healing effects\n\nVitamin A seems to have the opposite effect of steroids on wound healing. It stimulates the expression of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF), and increases collagen production, resulting in improved wound healing (320)."

        "query": "Vitamin B12",
        "mechanism_of_action": "General\n\nVitamin B12 is an essential water-soluble vitamin that is commonly found in a variety of foods, such as fish, shellfish, meat, eggs, and dairy products (74154). The term vitamin B12 refers to all cobalamins that are active as coenzymes in humans, including dibencozide (adenosylcobalamin), methylcobalamin, and hydroxocobalamin (5133). Vitamin B12 is required for nucleoprotein and myelin synthesis, cell reproduction, normal growth, and normal erythropoiesis. The synthetic forms of vitamin B12, cyanocobalamin and hydroxocobalamin, can be converted to coenzyme B12, which is essential for the conversion of methylmalonate to succinate, and the synthesis of methionine from homocysteine (15, 9320). Vitamin B12 is involved in maintaining sulfhydryl groups in the reduced form required by enzymes involved in fat and carbohydrate metabolism and protein synthesis. Vitamin B12 is essential for folate utilization, and its absence results in a functional folate deficiency (15).\n\nVitamin B12 deficiency can take months to years to become symptomatic due to large body stores. Normal serum vitamin B12 levels range between 200-900 pg/mL. Serum concentrations less than 200 pg/mL indicate deficiency, and concentrations less than 100 pg/mL usually result in megaloblastic anemia or neurologic damage (15). Vitamin B12 deficiency results in megaloblastic anemia, gastrointestinal lesions, and neurologic damage, beginning with an inability to produce myelin and progressing to degeneration of the axon and nerve head (15). Neurologic symptoms caused by vitamin B12 deficiency can include neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression (6357), paresthesias, ataxia, memory loss, weakness, and personality and mood changes without anemia (1484, 1485, 3235, 5646). Some neurologic symptoms and elevated homocysteine levels can occur without any signs of B12 deficiency anemia (1484, 1485, 3235). Vitamin B12 deficiency is associated with impaired cognitive performance in adolescents (aged 10-16 years) who have been fed a strict vegetarian diet from infancy to 6 years of age. Consequences of low vitamin B12 intake during childhood and its effect on cognitive functioning in adulthood are unknown (10125). Elevated methylmalonate or methylmalonic acid (MMA) levels occur early in vitamin B12 deficiency, and may precede other symptoms (1484, 1485, 5646). In combination with homocysteine levels, MMA levels can be used to diagnose vitamin B12 deficiency (5646).\n\nThe risk for vitamin B12 deficiency is higher with increased age, male gender, and in people of Caucasian and Latin American descent. Deficiency in vitamin B12 results from insufficient intake, malabsorption from food, and other medical conditions (1484, 1485). However, body stores of vitamin B12 are large, and it is widely available in food. Vitamin B12 deficiency is almost always caused by a disorder of absorption (9518).\n\nDeficiency of vitamin B12 can be masked by folic acid, particularly in large doses. Folate will improve vitamin B12 associated anemia, but it will allow the neurologic abnormalities to progress. There is some concern that food fortified with folic acid can cause under-recognition of vitamin B12 deficiency, particularly in the elderly (5646).\n\nAnticancer effects\n\nVitamin B12 is believed to possess anticancer properties (82890), and supplementation of vitamin B12 may have a role in preventing cervical cancer (50130, 34609). However, although some epidemiological research disagrees (9454), most research has found that elevated plasma levels of vitamin B12 are associated with an increased risk of various types of cancer, including lung and prostate cancers and solid tumors (50411, 102383, 107743). It is unclear if increased intake of vitamin B12, either through the diet or supplementation, directly affects the risk of cancer. It is possible that having cancer increases the risk of vitamin B12 elevation. However, one observational study has found that the highest quintile of dietary intake of vitamin B12 is associated with a 75% increased incidence of developing esophageal cancer when compared with the lowest quintile in never drinkers, but not drinkers (107147). Also, human research suggests that elevated serum vitamin B12 levels associated with tumor markers may indicate poor survival in hepatocellular carcinoma patients (82887).\n\nCardiovascular effects\n\nVitamin B12 is required in one of the pathways for homocysteine metabolism. Remethylation of homocysteine to methionine requires folate and the methylcobalamin form of vitamin B12 as a cofactor (9407, 9409). Some evidence suggests elevated homocysteine levels might cause vascular endothelial cell damage, impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation due to reduced nitric oxide activity, increased oxidation and arterial deposition of low-density lipoproteins (LDL), increased platelet adhesiveness, and activation of the clotting cascade (2147, 9403, 9408). Vitamin B12 supplements have a small additive effect to folic acid in lowering fasting homocysteine levels, but probably only in people with vitamin B12 deficiency (2147, 50314, 50222, 50014, 50164). Elevated homocysteine concentrations are possibly associated with other conditions such as developing age-related macular degeneration (AMD), decreased cognitive function, impaired memory, Alzheimer disease, and vascular dementia (5646, 9330, 9331).\n\nHepatic effects\n\nIn vitro research shows that vitamin B12 inhibits hepatitis C virus replication. Additionally, some liver diseases appear to be associated with vitamin B12 deficiency secondary to impaired storage of vitamin B12 in the liver. Theoretically, supplementation with vitamin B12 may restore liver stores of vitamin B12 and improve virological response in patients with hepatitis. This has been demonstrated in preliminary clinical research (90386).\n\nNeurological effects\n\nLow vitamin B12 levels are possibly associated with chronic fatigue syndrome (6082). Some researchers think that vitamin B12 supplements could help symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome by correcting red blood cell abnormalities and improving oxygen delivery to tissues (6082). The methylcobalamin form of vitamin B12 might also influence melatonin levels. Methylcobalamin seems to improve alertness and reduce sleep time in humans with normal sleep patterns, possibly due to effects on melatonin (1349). Preliminary clinical research in elderly patients shows that taking B vitamins, including vitamin B12, reduces brain atrophy in the areas of the brain most affected by Alzheimer disease. This suggests that taking vitamin B12 along with other B vitamins might prevent or delay the progression to Alzheimer disease in some patients (90374). Additional evidence suggests that supplementation of B vitamins, including vitamin B12, may help prevent dementia by lowering homocysteine levels (50222, 50277). Some research shows that elevated serum homocysteine and low folate and vitamin B12 levels may be associated with poor cognitive function, cognitive decline, and dementia (82884).\n\nOtic effects\n\nLow vitamin B12 levels have been associated with hearing loss in elderly women (1482).\n\nVoice effects\n\nA small study in active adult singers shows that receiving an intramuscular injection of\n\nvitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) 1 mg tends to improve ease of singing and voice handicap, and reduce fatigue 3 days after the shot. However, the benefit did not reach statistical nor clinical significance when compared with baseline or placebo (104925)."

        "query": "Vitamin C",
        "mechanism_of_action": "General\n\nVitamin C is a commonly used water-soluble vitamin and essential nutrient. Although many mammals can produce vitamin C, humans must obtain vitamin C from foods and other sources (1964, 4844). It's contained in high concentration in fresh fruits and vegetables, especially citrus fruits. Vitamin C is labile, and the amount in foods can decrease significantly with cooking and storage (3042). Vitamin C has a role in several physiological functions. It is involved in tyrosine metabolism and is a cofactor in the synthesis of carnitine, thyroxin, norepinephrine, dopamine, and tryptophan (3042). Vitamin C is also involved in a variety of metabolic processes including oxidation-reduction reactions and cellular respiration, carbohydrate metabolism, synthesis of lipids and proteins, catabolism of cholesterol to bile acids, conversion of folic acid to folinic acid, and iron metabolism (5877). Vitamin C is probably best known for its effects as an antioxidant and its role in maintaining proper immune function (15). Normal plasma vitamin C levels typically exceed 0.3 mg/dL. When plasma levels exceed 1.4 mg/dL, excretion of vitamin C greatly increases (1965, 1969). Concentrations below 0.2 mg/dL indicate significant deficiency (1964). Vitamin C deficiency can cause fatigue, personality changes, and decline in psychomotor performance and motivation within 84 to 97 days. Some evidence suggests that subclinical vitamin C deficiency is more common in healthy people than generally recognized (9810). Since the nonspecific symptom of fatigue is often the first symptom of deficiency, vitamin C depletion may go undiagnosed (9809). Sustained vitamin C deficiency over 3 to 5 months results in symptomatic scurvy characterized by gingival swelling and bleeding, loosening of the teeth, hyperkeratosis, perifollicular hemorrhages, petechial hemorrhages in the viscera, and hemorrhages into the muscles of the arms, legs, and joints (1964). Severe scurvy may progress to neuritis, jaundice, fever, dyspnea, and death. In infants, vitamin C deficiency is initially manifested by listlessness, anorexia, irritability, and failure to thrive. Later symptoms result from hemorrhage and collagen deficiency, with seizures, shock, and death if left untreated (1965).\n\nAnti-inflammatory effects\n\nC-reactive protein (CRP) is an acute-phase protein that is produced by the liver in response to inflammation. Some research suggests that taking vitamin C 515-2000 mg daily can reduce CRP levels in people who are actively or passively exposed to cigarette smoke or air pollution (14010, 109466). Vitamin C also seems to reduce other markers of inflammation such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in individuals exposed to air pollution (109466). However, vitamin C 50 or 500 mg daily for up to 5 years does not appear to reduce CRP levels in patients with atrophic gastritis (90405), though vitamin C administered intravenously during and 48 hours after cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation does reduce CRP and sedimentation rate (114492).\n\nAnti-sepsis effects\n\nThere is interest in using vitamin C to improve outcomes in patients with sepsis. Observational research suggests that patients with septic shock are more likely to have low plasma levels of vitamin C and higher C-reactive protein (CRP) levels than critically ill, non-septic patients (100317). Exploratory clinical research in patients with severe sepsis shows that intravenous administration of vitamin C reduces CRP and procalcitonin levels, indicating an anti-inflammatory effect. It also attenuates an increase in thrombomodulin levels, possibly indicating a reduction in vascular endothelial injury (100318). Clinical research in patients with septic shock also suggests that intravenous vitamin C may increase levels of norepinephrine and precursors to endogenous norepinephrine synthesis such as tyrosine hydroxylase, tetrahydrobiopterin, and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase. As a result, this might lower the dose of norepinephrine required during sepsis treatment (114489). Preclinical research also shows that vitamin C can prevent the cytokine surges in early sepsis that activate and sequester neutrophils in the lung and contribute to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (102130). Laboratory research also suggests that vitamin C might alter cell membrane permeability in sepsis. The lipopolysaccharides (LPS) found in gram negative bacteria can cause cell membrane hyperpermeability. In vitro research shows that vitamin C with hydrocortisone reduces cell membrane permeability in LPS-treated human lung microvascular endothelial cells; however, this effect was not seen with either vitamin C or hydrocortisone alone (100314). Furthermore, animal research shows that administering intravenous vitamin C reduces oxidative stress, attenuates a reduction in heart rate, and improves survival in septic mice that are predicted to have worsened outcomes based on physiological measurements. This effect was not seen in mice that were predicted to have better outcomes prior to vitamin C administration, suggesting that benefits of vitamin C might be limited to more severe cases of sepsis (100313).\n\nAntiallergic effects\n\nThere is interest in using vitamin C for allergies such as allergic rhinitis. Some evidence suggests that low vitamin C levels are associated with higher plasma histamine levels (10611). Theoretically, people with low vitamin C levels might have worse symptoms of allergic rhinitis. There is also some evidence that vitamin C might also have weak antihistamine properties (1969).\n\nAntihypertensive effects\n\nTaking vitamin C orally, in combination with antihypertensive drugs, seems to decrease systolic blood pressure in some patients (2044, 13162, 83444, 83483). Animal research suggests that vitamin C reduces blood pressure by increasing levels of the antioxidant glutathione, as well as improving insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism (30859).\n\nAntioxidant effects\n\nPotentially beneficial effects of vitamin C are attributed primarily to antioxidant and free radical scavenging effects. Vitamin C readily undergoes reversible oxidation and reduction in the body (1963). Vitamin C decreases oxidants in gastric juice, decreases lipid peroxidation, and decreases oxidative DNA and protein damage (3042, 83215). Damage by reactive oxygen species is thought to be a contributing factor to a number of diseases including dementia, asthma, hypertension, osteoarthritis, and cancer. However, in a rat model of exercise under polluted conditions, administration of vitamin C only very modestly improved markers of oxidative stress (106940). Researchers theorize that antioxidants such as vitamin C might protect against some diseases associated with oxidative damage. For example, in hypertension, endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO), which causes vasodilation, might be inhibited by superoxide anions. Vitamin C can scavenge the superoxide anions and theoretically help patients with hypertension. However, in this case there is some evidence that oral doses might not reach concentrations high enough for this effect (5879). Free oxygen radicals are also produced during cardiopulmonary bypass procedures, causing plasma vitamin C to drop by 70% within 24 hours of surgery (102127).\n\nCardiovascular effects\n\nIn people with chronic heart failure, intra-arterial vitamin C seems to improve endothelial dysfunction and flow-dependent dilation of the arteries. Vitamin C appears to prevent inactivation of nitric oxide (NO)-mediated vasodilation. Four weeks of oral vitamin C 1 gram twice daily appears to produce a similar effect (2434). In patients with coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes, vitamin C 2 grams daily seems to improve endothelium-dependent vasodilation (14009). Vitamin C also seems to improve endothelial function and vascular resistance in patients with chronic renal failure (14014, 14017, 83222).\n\nThere's also some evidence that vitamin C might suppress the apoptosis (death) of endothelial cells of patients with congestive heart failure, but the clinical relevance of this isn't known (9816). Intracoronary infusion of vitamin C has been shown to enhance the inotropic response to dobutamine (Dobutrex), possibly by reducing oxidative stress caused by beta-adrenergic stimulation of the ventricle (2432). Some researchers think vitamin C might prevent or slow atherosclerosis by inhibiting low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol; by impairing the products of reactive oxygen species from vascular cells; and by limiting the cellular responses to oxidized LDL, such as production of endothelium-derived NO (9812). There is some evidence that vitamin C reduces LDL cholesterol levels in patients with hypercholesterolemia (83445). In patients with coronary spastic angina, vitamin C seems to improve endothelial function when given by intravenous infusion as a single 2 gram dose (9819). Some research suggests that endothelial function may relate to insulin resistance in patients with hypertension. Single-dose intravenous vitamin C seems to improve endothelial function and restore insulin-mediated vasodilatation, but doesn't seem to improve glucose uptake (9820). Oral vitamin C seems to improve endothelial function in healthy young smokers, short term; the improvements in endothelial function diminish within 8 weeks, even though vitamin C levels remain elevated (9818).\n\nIn smokers, a single 3 gram dose given by intravenous infusion appears to restore coronary microcirculatory responsiveness and impaired coronary flow reserve induced by the oxidant effects of smoking. Vitamin C might reduce oxidative stress caused by the large number of oxidants in cigarette smoke (1956). Whether these effects are sustained when vitamin C is taken chronically is unknown. Pulmonary function is also positively related to dietary vitamin C intake in smokers and nonsmokers (2400).\n\nAnti-fibrillatory effects of vitamin C are possibly related to the prevention of oxidative byproducts in atrial tissue. Benefits do not seem to be directly electrophysiological (96705).\n\nA meta-analysis of cardiac and noncardiac patients, most of whom have normal cardiac function, shows that vitamin C may improve left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), with an average increase of 12% and 5% in cardiac and non-cardiac patients, respectively, when compared with either placebo or no treatment. It is unclear if route of administration may affect outcomes. Greater benefit was observed in patients with lower baseline LVEF levels (108074).\n\nChemotherapy-modulating effects\n\nSome researchers theorize that antioxidants, such as vitamin C, might make chemotherapy more effective by reducing oxidative stress that could interfere with apoptosis (cell death) of cancer cells (14012, 14013). However, vitamin C could also reduce the activity of chemotherapy drugs that generate free radicals (391). Preliminary data from a mouse lymphoma model indicate that vitamin C pretreatment reduces the efficacy of doxorubicin (16407). Leukemia and lymphoma cell culture studies also suggest that vitamin C pretreatment can reduce the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin, cisplatin, vincristine, methotrexate, and imatinib. Since this list includes drugs which do not generate free radicals, mechanisms other than the antioxidant effects of vitamin C may be involved. This might include prevention of the mitochondrial membrane depolarization caused by many chemotherapy drugs, which is involved in regulating cell death (16407).\n\nDermatologic effects\n\nFree radicals are also generated in the skin by exposure to ultraviolet light and cause photo-aging. Vitamin C in the skin is believed to play a key role in neutralizing these free radicals and reducing UV skin damage. Topical application of vitamin C is thought to prevent skin damage when applied prior to UV exposure due to vitamin C's antioxidant effects (6062, 6155). Topical preparations are thought to help treat photo-aged and wrinkled skin due to vitamin C's antioxidant properties and by possibly by increasing collagen production and improving collagen organization (6155, 14008). Topical preparations containing 10% vitamin C might be most effective for increasing vitamin C concentrations in the skin. Because vitamin C is water soluble, oral supplementation of vitamin C might not produce high enough concentrations in the skin to treat photo-aged skin (6064, 6155). Topical application of vitamin C has been shown to increase collagen production and improve collagen organization (83421).\n\nErgogenic effects\n\nResearch in marathon runners suggests vitamin C might help post-race immune suppression. Vitamin C 1500 mg taken daily for 7 days before running seems to reduce post-exercise serum cortisol and cytokines (11961).\n\nGastrointestinal effects\n\nA small clinical study in healthy adults shows that supplementation with vitamin C 1000 mg daily for 2 weeks can modulate the gut microbiota, leading to beneficial shifts in bacterial populations (106623).\n\nImmunostimulant effects\n\nBecause of vitamin C's role in maintaining normal immune function, a lot of people use it for treating and preventing infectious conditions such as the common cold. T-lymphocyte activity, phagocyte function, leukocyte mobility, and possibly antibody and interferon production seem to be increased by vitamin C (1963, 1965, 83560). Additionally, clinical research shows an increase in vitamin C levels in leukocytes after the administration of vitamin C and liposomal vitamin C (LipoVantage, Specnova, LLC) (115612). Some researchers think that vitamin C levels in white blood cells decrease at the onset of a cold and that boosting vitamin C intake might be beneficial (83214). There is some evidence vitamin C might have other effects in patients with the common cold. Vitamin C might protect normal tissues against reactive oxygen species that are produced by phagocytes during a viral infection. It might also enhance the proliferative responses of T-lymphocytes (1988). There is preliminary evidence vitamin C excretion might actually decrease during a cold, indicating that patients may retain vitamin C. However, absorption of vitamin C is unchanged during a cold (1986). Some researchers think vitamin C supplements might be useful to prevent other respiratory viral infections, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), but there are no reliable clinical studies to support this hypothesis (14015).\n\nMusculoskeletal effects\n\nSince vitamin C is a cofactor in the synthesis of collagen, there is interest in its effects for tendon healing. A preliminary clinical study in adults after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair shows that taking vitamin C 500 mg daily for 45 days does not improve postoperative outcomes when compared with no supplementation. However, there was a non-significant trend to an increased healing rate (radiographically measured) in the vitamin C group (105460). This study was limited by a lack of placebo control and inappropriate randomization.\n\nRadiotherapy effects\n\nFor radiation-induced oral mucositis, the reduced form of vitamin C might be beneficial due to its antioxidant effect and role in maintaining connective tissue integrity (6103). Vitamin C may also reduce toxicity of reactive oxygen during radio-immunotherapy due to its antioxidant effects (5878).\n\nHowever, there is some concern that vitamin C might reduce the efficacy of radiotherapy. In vitro research suggests that pretreatment with vitamin C prior to irradiation might enhance breast cancer proliferation and reduce radiosensitivity, although these effects appear to depend on cancer type. Human epidermal growth factor 2-positive cells appeared to be more sensitive to vitamin C when compared with triple-negative or estrogen receptor-positive cells. An observational study in patients with breast cancer undergoing radiotherapy did not find an association between vitamin C supplementation and risk of breast cancer recurrence over a period of 5 years. However, even though the vitamin C group had notably less aggressive tumor types, recurrence-free survival was similar in both vitamin C and control groups (108082).\n\nUricosuric effect\n\nVitamin C is used for gout because it is thought to have a uricosuric effect and lower serum levels of uric acid. Some research shows that healthy subjects who take vitamin C 4 grams have uric acid clearance increased by over 200% within 2-6 hours. Vitamin C might compete with uric acid for renal reabsorption via the proximal tubules (16755, 16756, 16757, 16758, 16759). A meta-analysis in a heterogenous population shows that oral vitamin C supplementation at doses of 200-2000 mg daily for 14 days to 6 months is associated with reduced serum levels of uric acid. The effect of oral vitamin C supplementation on serum levels of uric acid is greater in patients younger than 65 years, at durations less than 1 month, and when used alone (106619)."

        "query": "Vitamin D",
        "mechanism_of_action": "General\n\nVitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin. The term vitamin D refers to several forms of vitamin D. There are 2 forms that are physiologically important, ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) and cholecalciferol (vitamin D3). Ergocalciferol comes from ergosterol, a plant sterol, and yeast. Cholecalciferol is synthesized in the skin via 7-dehydrocholesterol, a cholesterol precursor. Both ergocalciferol and cholecalciferol are biologically inert and require hydroxylation in the body to form the active metabolite, calcitriol (7555, 16890). Since the early 1900s, ergocalciferol and cholecalciferol have been considered to be equally potent and effective in humans. However, more recently, research shows that cholecalciferol is significantly more potent than ergocalciferol and is more effective at improving total 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels (11937, 11938, 15263, 15264, 16119, 107228). Ergocalciferol appears to be less than one-third the potency of cholecalciferol (11937, 11938, 15263, 15264, 16119). A blood concentration of 20 ng/mL 25-hydroxyvitamin D is considered the level to meet the bodily needs of 97.5% of the population. Lower amounts are usually considered a 'deficiency'. Higher concentrations of 32 ng/mL are preferred (15638, 93945). Most laboratories consider the \"normal\" range to be 20 ng/mL to 100 ng/mL (16119). Very few foods naturally contain vitamin D. Dietary sources include eggs from hens that have been fed vitamin D and fatty fish such as herrings, mackerel, sardines, and tuna. In the US, Canada, and many other countries, the main source of dietary vitamin D is fortified milk and other foods. However, these are relatively minor sources of vitamin D (7555).\n\nBrief exposure to sunlight (about 25% of the amount of time it would take to cause light pinkness to the skin) is the most efficient way to get vitamin D (11935). Skin exposure to the sun provides as much as 80% to 90% of the body's vitamin D stores (7133). Full-body sun exposure can lead to the synthesis of as much as 10,000 units of vitamin D daily (6855). Vitamin D is stored in body fat for use during periods without sun exposure. Sun exposure is an easy, reliable way for most patients to get vitamin D. Exposure of the hands, face, arms, and legs to sunlight two to three times a week for the amount of time equal to about 25% of what it would take to develop a mild sunburn will cause the skin to produce adequate vitamin D. Exposure time will vary with skin type, season, and time of day (12992). Conversely, excessive sun exposure causes photodegradation of vitamin D produced in the skin, limiting the risk of vitamin D toxicity from such exposure (11936).\n\nVitamin D insufficiency, based on blood levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D below 20 ng/mL, is common in the northern latitudes such as Canada and the northern half of the US (12995). Interestingly, these levels also occur in as many as 40% of older people even in sunny climates such as South Florida (15637). Prevalence of vitamin D considered insufficient and deficient among young, healthy people appears to be increasing, possibly because of excessive use of sunscreens (12995). Exposure to sunlight might not always be sufficient to cause vitamin D synthesis in the skin. Sunlight intensity is dependent on latitude, altitude, season, cloud cover, ozone levels and other factors. During winter in some northern latitudes (e.g., northern US and Canada), little, if any, vitamin D3 is produced in the skin. For example, in Boston there is insufficient UV-B energy for vitamin D production in the skin for 4 months of the year. In Edmonton, the skin can't produce vitamin D for 5 months of the year (12998, 12999, 13000). Underway submariners, who get no sunlight for extended periods of time, have lowered 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and evidence of bone resorption and turnover, even when supplemented with 400 IU daily of cholecalciferol. The capacity of UV-B mediated vitamin D synthesis is huge. Just 6 days of casual sunlight exposure without sunscreen can make up for 49 days of no sunlight exposure (12998).\n\nSkin pigmentation affects vitamin D synthesis and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. A light-skinned person in a bathing suit who is not tanned would receive about 10,000 to 20,000 IU of cholecalciferol from 10-12 minutes of peak July summer sun in Boston. For a darker-skinned person, such as Asian Indian, getting this dose of vitamin D could take perhaps 30 minutes of exposure, and, for a very darkly pigmented African American, it could require 120 minutes of exposure (12997). The skin pigment melanin competes with vitamin D precursors in the skin for photons from UV-B light (6857). When serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are adjusted for percent body fat, White females have serum levels 1.3-1.9 times higher than Black females (16887). This also affects vitamin D in breast milk. For example, breast milk from Black females is generally lower in vitamin D content than that from White females (35 units/L compared with 68 units/L, respectively) (6857). Black infants who are exclusively breast-fed are therefore at risk for vitamin D deficiency and rickets, even if they live in sunny climates such as the southern US (6857). Vitamin D supplements may be needed by elderly people with limited sun exposure, people living in northern latitudes, dark-skinned people, Asian Indians living in the western hemisphere, as well as people with gastrointestinal diseases leading to malabsorption of vitamin D from the diet (6855, 7133).\n\nVitamin D deficiency, based on blood levels <20 ng/mL, is particularly common in adults over age 50 years. More than 50% of North American females receiving therapy to prevent or treat osteoporosis have inadequate vitamin D stores (12996). Factors such as lack of exposure to sunlight, reduced skin synthesis of vitamin D, lower dietary intake, impaired intestinal absorption, chronic kidney disease, and reduced metabolism to active forms of vitamin D by the kidneys increase with aging (11919, 16883). Also, vitamin D receptors seem to decrease with age (11921). The risk for vitamin D deficiency in elderly adults (>65 years) is very high (12995, 12996). The risk for severe vitamin D deficiency is even greater with advanced age. A survey of 104 adults older than 98 years old found blood levels of vitamin D were detectable in only 5 adults. This correlates to a blood level of less than 2 ng/mL (16874).\n\nBody mass index seems to affect vitamin D status. There is some evidence that individuals with a body mass index (BMI) of >25kg/m2 have reduced serum vitamin D levels and/or reduced bioavailability of vitamin D from both cutaneous synthesis and gastrointestinal absorption (6856, 110817). In response to similar UV-B exposures, the increase in serum vitamin D levels can be 57% less in people with obesity than in those with lower BMIs (6856). In individuals with a BMI of at least 25 kg/m2, taking cholecalciferol 2000 IU for 5 years modestly reduces the response to supplementation when compared with individuals with a BMI of up to 25 kg/m2 (110817). The content of vitamin D precursors in the skin are similar in both groups, suggesting that vitamin D synthesis is not affected by BMI, but that vitamin D is possibly sequestered into body fat, reducing its availability (6856).\n\nThe main function of vitamin D is to regulate serum calcium and phosphorus concentrations. Vitamin D enhances the efficiency of the intestinal absorption of calcium, primarily in the duodenum and jejunum, and phosphorus, particularly in the jejunum and ilium (7555). In the absence of adequate vitamin D, only 10% to 15% of calcium is absorbed and phosphorus absorption is only 60%. In the presence of vitamin D, calcium absorption increases to 30% to 40% and phosphorus absorption to 80% (16890). Vitamin D can increase serum calcium levels, but this effect is modest in healthy people in doses less than 1200 IU daily. If dietary intake of calcium is inadequate, calcitriol in combination with parathyroid hormone mobilizes calcium stores from bone. Calcitriol also appears to have effects in the brain, heart, pancreas, mononuclear cells, activated lymphocytes, and skin, but its exact physiologic role is unclear (7555).\n\nThe hydroxylation of vitamin D to calcitriol occurs in the kidneys. People with chronic renal failure may require forms of vitamin D such as calcitriol, dihydrotachysterol, or calcifediol that don't require renal hydroxylation (7555).\n\nIn people with granulomatous disorders such as tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, and histoplasmosis, vitamin D metabolism is disturbed. Vitamin D is converted to calcitriol by activated macrophages trapped in the pulmonary alveoli and granulomatous inflammation, in addition to the kidneys. This may increase the risk of hypercalcemia (7555, 11881).\n\nAnti-inflammatory effects\n\nAlthough some individual clinical trials disagree (110812, 110828), an overarching meta-analysis of 23 individual meta-analyses shows that vitamin D supplementation in adults reduces serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), as well as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and malondialdehyde. However, there were no effects on levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) or total antioxidant capacity (109731). Meta-analyses of clinical studies in postmenopausal adults, as well as adults with type 2 diabetes or COVID-19, shows that taking vitamin D reduces CRP levels when compared with control (113583, 115575, 115581). Clinical research in adults with ulcerative colitis, allergic rhinitis, or chronic urticaria shows that vitamin D modestly reduces levels of the inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha, CRP, and IL-6 and increases levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokines interferon gamma and IL-10 (109044, 112483, 11587). A meta-analysis of clinical research in patients with asthma also shows that taking vitamin D increases levels of IL-10 (114505). It is unclear whether these benefits are sustained in long-term studies. One large clinical trial shows that taking cholecalciferol alone or with omega-3 fatty acids reduces serum levels of CRP by 19% after 2 years, with no continued evidence of benefit after 4 years. Also, the levels of other inflammatory or anti-inflammatory mediators were not affected (110815). Vitamin D supplementation has also been found to reduce tissue and salivary levels of interferon-gamma (114586).\n\nAnti-malarial effects\n\nA meta-analysis of animal research suggests that vitamin D improves survival after Plasmodium infection. Researchers theorize that the benefits of vitamin D in animal models of malaria relate to its anti-inflammatory and immunologic effects (112023).\n\nAnti-oxidant effects\n\nThere is interest in vitamin D for its potential anti-oxidant effects. Clinical research in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) shows that vitamin D supplementation increases total antioxidant capacity and reduces malondialdehyde when compared with a control (114584).\n\nAnti-sepsis effects\n\nThere is interest in using vitamin D to improve outcomes in patients with sepsis. A meta-analysis of case-control studies shows that neonates and children with sepsis are more likely to have low serum levels of vitamin D than non-septic patients. However, a meta-analysis of cohort studies suggests that children with low serum vitamin D levels (< 20 ng/mL) do not have an increased risk of sepsis, mechanical ventilation, or mortality. This study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups (105722). It is unknown if treating low serum levels of vitamin D will prevent sepsis or improve outcomes in patients with sepsis.\n\nAntidiabetic effects\n\nThere is interest in whether supplementing with vitamin D can impact glycemic indices in diabetes. Vitamin D impacts the function of beta-cells by mediating calcium flux. Population research found that a lower vitamin D level is associated with a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to higher vitamin D levels (15630, 16713, 84594). Some preliminary clinical research suggests that vitamin D insufficiency may contribute to impairment of insulin secretion and insulin action (83898). Other clinical research in patients mostly without diabetes shows that supplementing with calcium 1000 mg or more daily in conjunction with vitamin D 2000 IU or more daily lowers fasting blood glucose and reduces insulin levels and insulin resistance measured by Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) (100893).\n\nHowever, it doesn't seem that vitamin D supplements can prevent or treat diabetes. Most evidence suggests that vitamin D does not significantly improve glycemic indices in patients with type 2 diabetes with adequate vitamin D status, but it may help prevent the development of type 1 diabetes when given to infants during early childhood (10139, 83898, 84225, 84488, 84594, 84636, 84645, 84808, 91347, 96403)(107210, 110822). Although supplementation with oral vitamin D, alone or in combination with omega-3 fatty acids, for 8 weeks actually seems to increase glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels by about 0.2% or 0.4%, respectively, in patients who are vitamin D-deficient and mostly healthy when compared with control, it should be noted that more patients receiving supplementation had prediabetes at baseline when compared with control (107192).\n\nBone effects\n\nSince vitamin D is important for calcium homeostasis and for bone health, it is used to help prevent osteoporosis. Early research suggested serum levels of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (calcifediol) of at least 16 ng/mL for optimal bone health (6854). This is supported by the dietary reference intakes (93945). However, some researchers suggest serum levels of 28 to 32 ng/mL may be necessary for bone health (13276). When intake of calcium is low in healthy elderly females, 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (calcifediol) seems to be more biologically active and a more important determinant of gut calcium absorption than calcitriol (10141). Osteopenia in elderly males also seems to correlate with circulating levels of vitamin D and vitamin K (7132). There is also concern that high dose vitamin D might result in lower bone mineral density (BMD); however, research has not shown consistent results. Clinical research in healthy adults shows that taking vitamin D for 3 years at a dose of 4000 IU daily or 10000 IU daily seems to result in lower radial BMD when compared with control of taking 400 IU daily. Tibial BMD was lower only with the 10 000 IU dose when compared with control. However, there were no differences between groups in BMD of the radius or tibia (100894).\n\nCancer effects\n\nThere is some epidemiological evidence that people with vitamin D deficiency might be at an increased risk of colon, breast, and prostate cancer (7555). Other evidence suggests that higher serum levels of vitamin D are associated with a decreased risk of cancer (16101). Some researchers think vitamin D might have antiproliferative effects in these cancers (6855). Prostate cancer has been associated with decreased sun exposure and vitamin D receptor activity (12994). Some evidence also suggests that vitamin D may play a role in the inhibition of cancer cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (16882).\n\nCardiovascular effects\n\nThere is interest in using vitamin D to prevent and treat cardiovascular disease. Vitamin D is thought to play a role in cardiovascular disease by affecting inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukins. Vitamin D might also decrease cardiac and vascular remodeling through suppression of the rennin gene and suppression of parathyroid hormone (14614, 16620, 16621, 16622). Some research shows that vitamin D supplementation might also suppress macrophage cholesterol uptake and decrease foam cell formation (16873). Clinical research in adults with heart failure shows that taking vitamin D with calcium reduces serum aldosterone levels, but does not alter serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), or galectin-3 (97300). There is also interest in whether vitamin D might reduce progression of atherosclerosis. However, a meta-analysis of clinical research shows that vitamin D supplementation has no effect on measures of endothelial function such as flow-mediated dilation, pulse wave velocity, and central augmentation index (103663, 103664).\n\nEvidence in humans also suggests that taking vitamin D may result in a reduction in blood pressure. However, not all studies agree. It is possible that blood pressure lowering effects associated with vitamin D are related to direct effects on the vascular cells or a suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (84226, 84364, 84410, 84554, 84631, 84692). There is interest in whether a mega-dose of vitamin D can decrease the resting blood pressure in elderly females with hypertension, enhance post-exercise hypotension, and improve autonomic nervous modulation. A small case control study in older females with hypertension shows that taking a single dose of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) 200,000 IU does not reduce resting blood pressure, but might reduce post-exercise systolic hypotension, and increase the low frequency/high frequency (LF/HF) ratio, a controversial measure of sympathovagal balance (103657).\n\nGastrointestinal effects\n\nThere is interest in the anti-inflammatory effects of vitamin D in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), which involves chronic recurrent inflammation of the colon. A small clinical study in patients with mild-to-moderate UC shows that receiving a single muscular injection of 7.5 mg vitamin D3 decreases serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interferon-c, and interleukin (IL)-12p70 levels, but not IL-4 and IL-10 levels, when compared with an injection of normal saline (100898). Also, a meta-analysis of clinical research in patients with UC shows that taking vitamin D modestly reduces levels of IL-6, TNF-alpha, and C-reactive protein (CRP) and improves the repair function of intestinal mucosa (109044).\n\nHematologic effects\n\nAn observational study in patients with vitamin D deficiency has found that supplementation with vitamin D is associated with reduced platelet concentrations (107229).\n\nHepatoprotective effects\n\nThere is interest in using vitamin D to treat or prevent hepatic fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C. However, preliminary clinical research in adults with serum vitamin D levels <30 ng/mL and a sustained virological response after hepatitis C treatment shows that taking vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) 60,000-100,000 IU weekly for 6 weeks does not reduce serum levels of hepatic fibrinogenesis markers, such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) and amino terminal type III procollagen peptide (P3NP), when compared with placebo. However, this study did not evaluate liver biopsies for fibrosis (105723).\n\nHormonal effects\n\nThere is interest in using vitamin D to increase testosterone levels in males and improve the hormone profile in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). However, a small clinical study in middle-aged males with low testosterone levels shows that taking vitamin D 20,000 IU daily for 12 weeks does not affect levels of serum total testosterone, free testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin, follicle-stimulating hormone, estradiol, or luteinizing hormone (103660). Clinical research in patients with PCOS shows that vitamin D supplementation reduces total testosterone levels but does not modify levels of sex-hormone binding globulin or free androgen index (114584).\n\nImmunologic effects\n\nVitamin D may have immunologic activity. In models of autoimmune disease, vitamin D seems to act as an immunosuppressant. This might explain why increased vitamin D intake is associated with a lower risk of autoimmune diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis) (12206, 84529, 107184). Additionally, people with autoimmune disease seem to have lower serum vitamin D levels than healthy controls (112482, 112483). Some evidence suggests vitamin D supplementation during infancy might prevent the development of type 1 diabetes later on in life. Type 1 diabetes is believed to be an autoimmune disease. Vitamin D supplementation might inhibit an autoimmune reaction that targets the beta cells of the pancreas (10139, 16886).\n\nVitamin D has also shown other immunologic effects. Some research shows that CD4+ T cell counts are lower in patients with tuberculosis and low vitamin D status when compared with those with normal vitamin D status, and that supplementation with vitamin D as calcitriol increases these T cell counts (109045). Another study in patients with allergic rhinitis suggests that vitamin D reduces CD4+ and CD4+/CD8+ ratio and increases CD8+ serum levels (112483). In patients hospitalized with COVID-19, taking vitamin D increases neutrophil and lymphocyte counts, decreases levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), and alters the activity of B cells (109047).\n\nNeurologic effects\n\nA small meta-analysis of clinical studies in a mixed population shows that taking vitamin D improves sleep quality by 2 points on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) when compared with control (108433).\n\nRespiratory effects\n\nThere is interest in using vitamin D for improving respiratory disorders such as bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), and asthma. Epidemiological evidence suggests that 25-hydroxy vitamin D serum levels are associated with pulmonary function. People with higher levels seem to have greater pulmonary function as measured by FEV1 compared to people with lower levels. It is theorized that vitamin D might be involved in remodeling of lung tissue (14252, 17685). Vitamin D might also improve lung function by decreasing immune-mediated inflammation in the airway (14253, 84505, 84613).\n\nEvidence from a population based study suggests patients with low 25-hydroxy vitamin D serum levels are 27% to 55% more likely to have upper respiratory tract infections compared to patients with normal levels (16830), though clinical research has not shown that vitamin D supplementation reduces the incidence of acute respiratory infections in older adults (114506). It is also not known if taking vitamin D supplements improves pulmonary function. Vitamin D deficiency has been commonly reported in children with mild-to-moderate asthma and is also associated with increased risk of asthma exacerbations that are severe. Vitamin D receptor variants have been associated with asthma in some population studies. Additionally, population studies suggest that lower vitamin D levels are correlated with increased inhaled corticosteroid needs in children (17685).\n\nSkeletal muscle effects\n\nVitamin D deficiency causes muscle pain and proximal muscle weakness with symptoms such as sensation of heaviness in the legs, rapid fatigue, and problems with climbing stairs and getting up from a chair. Some preliminary clinical research suggests that people with low vitamin D levels, considered to be less than or equal to 20 ng/mL, have more osteoarthritis pain and disability than people with adequate vitamin D stores. Vitamin D deficiency also increases postural sway and affects psychomotor function (11922, 11923, 11924, 11925, 12491). Vitamin D may prevent falls by increasing muscle strength and neuromuscular function in addition to strengthening bone. It seems to increase muscle protein synthesis, possibly by activating second messengers and phosphorylation (11919, 11922). Some evidence also shows that higher serum levels of vitamin D is associated with improved lower-extremity function in people aged 60 years or older (15636). The standard dose of 400 units that is found in most multivitamin tablets appears to be too low to prevent falls or reduce fracture risk, but the optimal dose is unknown (11926, 11927, 11928). Fractures were reduced in clinical trials using 700 to 800 units of vitamin D daily (11930, 11931). Some research suggests that sufficient calcium intake along with vitamin D is necessary to prevent falls (11932).\n\nThyroid effects\n\nA meta-analysis of clinical studies in patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis shows that vitamin D supplementation reduces thyroid peroxidase antibody titers, especially when cholecalciferol is used for more than 3 months (108430).\n\nUterine effects\n\nVitamin D regulates cytochrome P450-27B1 and -24A1 enzymes, which are dysregulated in uterine fibroid disease. It also decreases growth of uterine fibroid cells, reducing expression of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 and cell proliferation nuclear antigen (113577)."

        "query": "Vitamin E",
        "mechanism_of_action": "General\n\nVitamin E is naturally occurring in many foods including vegetable oils, cereal grains, animal fats, meat, poultry, eggs, fruits, and vegetables (96). Vitamin E refers to eight different forms including alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-tocopherols and four tocotrienols. Most vitamin E in foods is gamma-tocopherol while most supplements contain alpha-tocopherol, which has the highest bioavailability and is used to set dietary requirements (107858). Unlike most nutrients, vitamin E does not appear to have a specific role in a required metabolic process.\n\nThe major function of vitamin E is probably that of a chain-breaking antioxidant that prevents the formation of free radicals. Vitamin E's therapeutic benefits have primarily been attributed to its antioxidant effects (4844, 12494, 13501, 30898). Alpha-tocopherol is the most active form in humans. Although biological activity of other forms is significantly less and current guidelines do not include forms of vitamin E other than alpha-tocopherol for meeting dietary requirements (4844), the other forms, such as gamma-tocopherol and the tocotrienols, have been associated with some pharmacological activity. For example, gamma-tocopherol appears to decrease the programmed death of human coronary artery endothelial cells.\n\nThere is some concern that high doses of vitamin E might have a pro-oxidant rather than an antioxidant effect (12495, 13036, 16823). Alpha-tocopherol-mediated peroxidation (TMP) occurs in vitro, but whether this occurs in vivo isn't clear (13504). High doses of vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) alone might disrupt the normal antioxidant balance and decrease the effect of other vitamin E isomers such as gamma-tocopherol and other antioxidants (12496, 13036). In early pregnancy, this imbalance may adversely affect uteroplacental tissues, affect development of placenta-related disease, and embryogenesis (16823).\n\nAnalgesic effects\n\nVitamin E is thought to reduce pain by decreasing the production of prostaglandins via prevention of phospholipid peroxidation and arachidonic acid release (99367).\n\nAnti-dementia effects\n\nVitamin E has been studied for its ability to slow the progression of Alzheimer disease, possibly due to an interaction with free radicals and a disruption of cellular damage (11472). Preliminary data suggest vitamin E might improve cognitive function by decreasing beta-amyloid damage (4637, 4638, 4639).\n\nAnti-diabetic effects\n\nVitamin E might be beneficial in diabetes. Population research shows that higher vitamin E intake is associated with a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes (14004). Some clinical research shows that taking vitamin E improves glucose disposal in patients with type 2 diabetes (4726). However, vitamin E supplementation does not seem to affect insulin resistance measured by the homoeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index, and only improves glycemic parameters in patients with diabetes that also have low vitamin E levels at baseline (13496, 90095, 90099, 98259).\n\nAnti-inflammatory effects\n\nA meta-analysis of clinical research in patients with various conditions shows that taking vitamin E seems to modestly lower inflammatory markers, such as serum C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, when compared with control (104406). A meta-analysis of 11 trials in patients on hemodialysis shows that taking vitamin E, typically in a dose of 400 IU daily for 2-20 weeks, decreases markers of endothelial dysfunction and vascular inflammation, including intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and markers of systemic inflammation including CRP, when compared with placebo or no treatment. There was no effect on IL-6 (107863).\n\nAntineoplastic effects\n\nIncreased vitamin E intake has been associated with a reduced risk of various cancers such as renal cancer, bladder cancer, gastric cancer, and many others (3360, 90083, 98262). Theoretically, vitamin E reduces oxidative damage, which is associated with the development of cancers (5882). Several mechanisms have been theorized for reducing carcinogenesis, including the neutralization of reactive oxygen species, the inhibition of the formation of nitrosamines, and enhancement of immune function (9839, 98262). Preliminary evidence also shows that vitamin E and other antioxidants can decrease oxidative damage associated with tumor-directed radio-immunotherapy (5882). Vitamin E is used for photo-aged skin and to prevent oxidative skin damage related to ultraviolet (UV) radiation (e.g., sunburn) due to its antioxidant effects. However, some researchers think that this benefit requires concomitant use with other antioxidants such as vitamin C to prevent degradation of vitamin E (6062, 6064). Chemotherapy and radiation therapy also adversely affect vitamin E status (98).\n\nVitamin E inhibits protein kinase C activity, which is involved in cell proliferation and differentiation in several cell types, including smooth muscle, platelets, and monocytes (4844). Preliminary research suggests that vitamin E might have an antiproliferative effect on benign hyperplastic prostate cells (11235). Population studies suggest an association between low serum levels of alpha-tocopherol and higher risk of prostate cancer (12874). In vitro research suggests that gamma-tocopherol, the primary vitamin E form in food, inhibits proliferation of prostate cancer cells, but alpha-tocopherol has no effect (4089, 13503). This inhibitory effect of vitamin E on prostate cancer cells might be due to its antiandrogen activity (12875, 12876). RRR-alpha-tocopheryl succinate, known as vitamin E succinate (VES), is currently being researched for its chemotherapeutic and chemopreventive potential. VES has been shown to inhibit tumor cell growth, primarily by triggering apoptosis in human prostate carcinoma (3361). There is some evidence that the inhibitory effect on cancer cell growth by statin drugs with a closed ring structure, such as mevastatin and lovastatin (Mevacor), may be enhanced when used with alpha tocopheryl succinate (8046).\n\nApolipoprotein effects\n\nA meta-analysis of clinical research shows that oral alpha-tocopherol in doses of 100-1200 IU daily does not have a significant effect on apolipoproteins A1 or B100 (107860).\n\nCardiovascular effects\n\nOxidative damage has been attributed to many conditions for which vitamin E is used, including lipid peroxidation in heart disease (6204). Some preliminary research suggests that vitamin E might inhibit the local inflammatory process and oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol that is associated with atherosclerosis (97, 249), but when this theory was tested in healthy adults without heart disease, RRR-alpha-tocopherol, even at 2000 IU/day, did not produce markers that indicate a reduction in lipid oxidation (13159).\n\nIt also does not appear to reduce levels of C-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation that is associated with cardiovascular disease, when used in combination with vitamin C and alpha-lipoic acid (14010, 85129). This appears to be another case where promising laboratory data turns out to be clinically irrelevant. Vitamin E also doesn't appear to improve endothelium-dependent vasodilation in older adults with hypercholesterolemia (11286).\n\nThe tocotrienols from rice and barley bran might lower total cholesterol and LDL, possibly by decreasing activity of HMG CoA reductase, but in a different way than \"statin\" drugs (3237, 3238, 3239, 3240, 3241). Tocotrienols might also be capable of decreasing carotid artery plaque size in some people, possibly by decreasing platelet aggregation (3239). Vitamin E might also lower the protective high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. This potential pro-oxidant effect could result in adverse cardiovascular outcomes (13036).\n\nGamma-tocopherol appears to prolong prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times and has caused hemorrhage in experimental animals (4098). Beta- and delta-tocopherol have also been shown to prolong prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times in laboratory animals (4098).\n\nLarge amounts of vitamin E interfere with vitamin K-dependent clotting factor production, producing hypoprothrombinemic effects, especially in people with vitamin K deficiency or those who are taking oral anticoagulants (3073, 3074). Mixed tocopherols seem to have a greater effect on platelet aggregation than alpha-tocopherol alone, which might explain the discrepancy between the effects of dietary vitamin E intake and supplemental vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) in cardiovascular disease. Mixed tocopherols seem to increase nitric oxide (NO) release and superoxide dismutase (SOD) protein content in platelets, which may contribute to the effect on platelet aggregation (10364).\n\nCentral nervous system (CNS) effects\n\nIn tardive dyskinesia, it is thought that some patients may have increased dopamine turnover resulting in increased production of free radicals and structural damage. The antioxidant effects of vitamin E may reduce the number of free radicals that increase dopamine turnover. Additionally, people with tardive dyskinesia may have decreased levels of vitamin E and vitamin C (3598).\n\nAlso, in the treatment of epilepsy, vitamin E is primarily used because some patients taking anti-epileptic drugs have decreased blood levels of vitamin E. Vitamin E might also act as a membrane stabilizer and enzyme repressor in these patients (3356, 6066).\n\nDeficiency\n\nVitamin E deficiency is rare and most typically seen in genetic abnormalities that prevent maintenance of normal blood concentrations of vitamin E or conditions that prevent absorption. Vitamin E deficiency does not cause specific disease in adults, although creatinuria, ceroid deposition, muscle weakness, and decreased erythrocyte survival are associated with low serum vitamin E concentrations. In adults, total body stores of vitamin E, found in adipose tissue, have been estimated to be 3-8 grams and are sufficient to meet the body's requirements for 4 or more years of a deficient diet. In premature infants, vitamin E deficiency can cause irritability, edema, thrombosis, and hemolytic anemia (15).\n\nSome evidence links asthma to increased oxidative stress and vitamin E deficiency. Epidemiological and case-control studies have associated asthma with lower vitamin E intake, lower vitamin E serum levels, lower vitamin E levels in lung lining fluid, and maternal vitamin E intake during pregnancy (315, 401, 409, 422, 6058, 15006). But clinical studies using vitamin E for asthma have not been performed.\n\nVitamin E might also work by non-antioxidant mechanisms. Preliminary research suggests that it affects cellular signaling and modifies gene expression in cerebellar cells involved in the regulation of coordinated movement. Cerebellar ataxia is a symptom of vitamin E deficiency (13505).\n\nImmunomodulating effects\n\nVitamin E may play a role in allergic reactions. Lower vitamin E serum levels have also been associated with higher IgE levels and positive allergen skin tests (5275).\n\nFor immune function in the elderly, vitamin E supplementation might replenish an inapparent deficiency. Deficiency of vitamin E and other micronutrients are common in apparently well-nourished people over age 90 and might affect the number and function of natural killer cells in old age (4688). Most research suggests that vitamin E supplementation in healthy elderly people improves response to delayed-type hypersensitivity skin testing (DTH), an indicator of immune function, and antibody response to hepatitis B, tetanus and diphtheria, and pneumococcal vaccines (4676, 4689, 4690, 4691). But whether vitamin E supplementation results in better health in elderly people is unknown.\n\nNeuroprotective effects\n\nSmall clinical studies in patients with diabetes show that taking a specific tocotrienol-rich vitamin E supplement (Tocovid SupraBio, Hovid Nutriworld) for up to 1 year seems to modestly increase nerve conduction velocity when compared with placebo (104427, 107388).\n\nRenal effects\n\nSome researchers think the antioxidant activity of vitamin E may slow progression of renal disease. Oxidative metabolites may accumulate in renal dysfunction. Vitamin E could theoretically slow the rate of decline in chronic inflammatory kidney diseases such as IgA nephropathy, diabetic nephropathy, and glomerulosclerosis; and poisoning by nephrotoxic drugs and other compounds (10369). Furthermore, there has been some speculation that vitamin E intake might reduce the risk of renal cell carcinoma. Some population research shows that vitamin E intake is associated with a reduced risk of kidney cancer or renal cell carcinoma (98262)."

        "query": "Zinc",
        "mechanism_of_action": "General\n\nZinc is a biologically essential trace element and is the second most abundant trace element in the body. The total body content is about 2 grams (8621). It is a cofactor in many biological processes including DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis. About 30% of cellular zinc is found within the nucleus. A large number of proteins that play a role in the regulation of gene expression are thought to contain zinc (8619). Zinc also plays a role in immune function, wound healing, reproduction, growth and development, behavior and learning, taste and smell, blood clotting, thyroid hormone function, and insulin action (331). Zinc is found in more than 300 enzymes (8619). About 300 enzymes depend on zinc as a catalyst (7135, 96074). Zinc is also required in hepatic synthesis of retinol binding protein, the transport protein of vitamin A (8630). Without adequate zinc, symptoms of vitamin A deficiency can appear, despite vitamin A supplementation (8630).\n\nMeat, seafood, dairy products, nuts, legumes, and whole grains contain relatively high concentrations of zinc (331). Many breakfast cereals are fortified with zinc (7135). Zinc oxide and zinc sulfate are typically used to fortify wheat products (10668).\n\nZinc deficiency is characterized by growth retardation, low insulin levels, reduced levels of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, anorexia, mental lethargy, irritability, low sperm count, generalized hair loss, rough and dry skin, skin lesions, slow wound healing, decreased thyroid function, delayed onset of puberty, poor sense of smell and taste, diarrhea, and nausea (8619). Although zinc deficiency and tri-iodothyronine (T3) have complementary roles in growth and development, growth failure in zinc deficiency does not seem to be the result of impaired T3 function (8619). Zinc deficiency is not uncommon worldwide, but deficiency is rare in the US; most diets provide more than the recommended dietary allowance (8632). Moderate zinc deficiency is associated with malabsorption syndromes, alcoholism, chronic renal disease, and chronic debilitating diseases (8621). Zinc levels also appear to be lower in acute attacks of paranoid schizophrenia (12584).\n\nThere is no reliable test in clinical use to determine zinc deficiency. Serum or plasma zinc on its own is neither sensitive nor specific. It seems to be useful to measure zinc status on a population basis, but is an inaccurate measure in individuals, particularly in people with chronic infections or inflammatory conditions (8625). The most reliable method for diagnosing marginal zinc deficiency is a positive response to zinc supplementation and improvement in subtle symptoms such as growth retardation or altered ability to taste or smell (8621).\n\nAnti-gingivitis effects\n\nMost clinical evidence shows that using zinc toothpaste or mouthwash alone or in combination with triclosan can prevent plaque accumulation, gingivitis, or the formation of calculus (6523, 6524, 6525, 6526, 6527, 6528, 6529, 87418, 87507). It is possible that this is due to antimicrobial effects of zinc (87012, 87217).\n\nAnti-inflammatory effects\n\nIt is hypothesized that low levels of plasma zinc may be one of the nonspecific features of inflammation (87440). In two meta-analyses, zinc supplementation reduced inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein (CRP), high-sensitivity (hs) CRP, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 6, malondialdehyde, and neutrophils (104820, 104952). In healthy elderly individuals, zinc has been shown to decrease inflammatory biomarkers for atherosclerosis, including hsCRP, macrophage chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), malondialdehyde and hydroxyalkenals (MDA+HAE) (87214, 96073). Also, zinc supplementation has been shown to decrease inflammatory biomarkers such as CRP in hemodialysis patients (87171). In addition, zinc supplementation reduces serum immunoglobulins and increases serum albumin, which appears to be associated with reduced joint paint, increased mobility, and decreased joint swelling in patients with psoriatic arthritis (6515). However, taking zinc orally does not seem to help treat rheumatoid arthritis (6517, 6518, 6519, 87406).\n\nTopical zinc might be effective for treating acne (819, 820, 2687, 2688) due to anti-inflammatory activity resulting from inhibition of polymorphonuclear leukocyte chemotaxis induced by decreased granulocyte zinc levels (104056).\n\nAnti-ulcer effects\n\nTaking zinc orally seems to help treat and prevent peptic ulcers in clinical research (6588, 6589, 6590, 6591, 87097, 87285). Although the mechanism of action is not clear, in human research, the antiulcer effects of zinc were suggested to be due to inhibition of gastric secretion as opposed to interactions on parietal cell receptors (87478).\n\nAntidiabetic effects\n\nZinc has been shown to decrease blood glucose and increase insulin levels in human studies (86933, 87520), but the mechanism of these effects is unclear. There is some evidence that zinc can increase glucose transport into cells and potentiate insulin-induced glucose transport, possibly by affecting the insulin intracellular signaling (second messenger system) pathway (8620). Zinc has also been shown to increase serum levels of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 by 30% and improve glucose tolerance (8624). Additionally, some animal research shows that zinc can prevent renal oxidative and inflammatory damage due to hyperglycemia in a rat model of diabetes, possibly via induced expression of metallothionein and suppressed connective tissue growth factor (87161). These results suggest that zinc's antidiabetic effects may be explained by antioxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms. Preliminary research also shows that some patients with type 2 diabetes are zinc deficient, possibly as a result of altered zinc metabolism (6531, 6532). Whether zinc deficiency is involved in the development of insulin resistance is unknown. In type 1 diabetes with zinc deficiency, zinc supplementation might reduce lipid peroxidation (6533).\n\nAntiviral effects\n\nThe mechanism for the effect of zinc on the common cold is unclear. It does not influence interleukin-8 in nasal secretions, suggesting that zinc does not affect the immune response to colds (10783, 10784). Zinc can inhibit rhinovirus replication in vitro, but it is unclear whether this happens in vivo (10783, 10784, 18216). The rhinovirus replicates in the nasal mucosa, and some researchers question whether orally administered zinc produces sufficient levels in nasal tissues and secretions to inhibit viral replication (8628, 8629). The amount of available ionized zinc varies with different formulations and might influence the effectiveness of zinc for the common cold (336, 340). The addition of flavoring agents such as citric acid, mannitol, or sorbitol to zinc gluconate lozenge preparations decreases the extent of zinc ionization, while the addition of glycine to zinc gluconate lozenges does not (300).\n\nZinc ions might also have effects against other viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and herpes virus (6538, 6539, 6541, 18216). In vitro research also shows that high intracellular zinc levels might stop replication of SARS-CoV-2, and zinc is also reported to have a synergistic effect with antivirals (106903).\n\nBiliary effects\n\nZinc is thought to be a cofactor for enzymes involved in the metabolism of bilirubin. It has been shown to reduce serum bilirubin levels in animals (104814).\n\nDermatologic effects\n\nClinical research suggests that zinc has beneficial effects on the skin when used orally or topically. For example, oral zinc can improve acne due to its anti-inflammatory activity (104056, 106233) and its ability to decrease skin sebum secretion (819, 87275, 87378, 106233). Some research also suggests that zinc has antimicrobial activity against Cutibacterium acnes (106233).\n\nTopical zinc, along with other antioxidants, appears to improve the look of aging skin (6155).\n\nFertility effects\n\nMale fertility appears to be influenced by zinc (6573, 6574, 6575, 6576). Infertile males have lower seminal plasma zinc, with normal or reduced blood zinc (6575, 6577). Clinical research suggests that short-term dietary zinc depletion results in reduced serum testosterone concentrations, seminal volume, and total seminal zinc loss per ejaculate (6576). Supplementation with zinc improves sperm parameters in men with reduced sperm mobility (6578). However, excess zinc might reduce sperm motility (6573). In male cigarette smokers with infertility, supplementation with zinc improved sperm quality, possibly by reducing testicular accumulation of cadmium induced by cigarette smoking (86915). In infertile men, zinc improved total sperm count (9334, 87430). Some of the benefits of zinc on fertility may be due to hormonal effects. For example, in human research, zinc increased serum testosterone or dihydrotestosterone levels in some (6708, 87430), but not all (6569, 87095) studies.\n\nImmunomodulating effects\n\nZinc is important for neutrophil, natural killer cell, and T-lymphocyte function (6551). Even mild zinc deficiency might adversely affect T-cell functions (6552). Interestingly, high-dose zinc supplementation, 20 times the RDA, can have a negative effect similar to deficiency on immune function (8625). In human research, zinc decreased levels of the suppressor T cells and increased the ratio of helper to suppressor cells (6578, 87156). Zinc, alone or with other micronutrients, has been shown to affect numbers of other CD(+) cells and other lymphocytes, and both increase an decrease levels of cytokines (824, 6555, 6566, 6578, 6596, 10809, 71430, 86910, 87065)(87115, 87140, 87246, 87317, 87414, 87453, 87514).\n\nIn children with enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli-induced diarrhea, zinc has been shown to modulate the innate immune system, as evidenced by an increase in phagocytic activity, a decrease in oxidative burst activity, and an increase in the ratio of naïve to memory T cells (87208). Also, in children with zinc deficiency, daily zinc supplementation seems to increase plasma levels of E. coli-specific IgG (109780). In healthy elderly individuals, zinc supplementation enhanced natural killer cell activity (87273); however, in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, zinc decreased natural killer cell activity (6915).\n\nPlasma zinc levels are low in people with HIV infection, but this appears to be a marker of disease progression rather than a treatable cause of progression. Some evidence suggests that zinc supplementation might increase disease progression and mortality in HIV infected patients, but other evidence suggests that avoiding zinc deficiency might allow normal or improved immune function, particularly T-lymphocyte mediated cellular immunity. It also might inhibit susceptibility of T-lymphocytes to apoptosis (8625). More research is needed to tell if zinc should be avoided or prescribed for zinc deficiency in HIV disease.\n\nPlasma levels of zinc are also lower in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). For over 30 years, researchers have been trying to determine the role of zinc in the pathogenesis of MS. Some preliminary clinical research found that zinc levels are reduced during an MS exacerbation and normalize during a remission. However, to date, no clinical research has shown zinc supplementation to be beneficial in patients with MS (97137).\n\nLipid metabolizing effects\n\nAcrodermatitis enteropathica is a zinc-deficiency disorder characterized by low plasma levels of zinc and decreased activity of the zinc-dependent enzyme alkaline phosphatase. Intestinal alkaline phosphatase helps regulate lipid absorption (90933). In patients with acrodermatitis enteropathica, zinc supplementation seems to help regulate linoleic acid and serum lipoprotein metabolism (2689).\n\nPreliminary clinical research suggests that taking zinc sulfate reduces serum cholesterol in patients with coronary artery disease (87299). However, in other clinical research, zinc has had mixed effects. For example, in individuals with low baseline cholesterol levels, zinc resulted in increased total and low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels and lacked an effect on high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels (86953). In other human research, zinc did not affect total cholesterol levels, but resulted in decreased LDL-cholesterol, and had mixed effects on HDL-cholesterol types, with increased HDL2 and a slight decrease in HDL3 (87306). The mixed effect of zinc on these parameters may be due to dosing, the age and/or sex of the participant, or baseline zinc and/or plasma lipid levels (87193).\n\nNeurologic effects\n\nThere is interest in using zinc for various neurological conditions. The role of zinc in Alzheimer disease might be both protective and causative. Laboratory studies suggest that zinc might contribute to aggregation of amyloid beta peptide, but protect against subsequent neurotoxicity as an antioxidant (6510, 6511, 6512). Zinc levels and zinc intake appear to be reduced in some people with depression (6562, 90227, 97139). In the human brain, zinc is believed to play a role in the hippocampus in communication between neurons (90221, 97139). Zinc is also believed to potentiate the activity of some antidepressants (90221). Some clinical evidence shows that taking zinc along with antidepressant treatment improves depression scores in patients diagnosed with major depression better than antidepressant alone (86985, 90221).\n\nOcular effects\n\nZinc plays a key role in the maintenance of vision. It is present in high concentrations in the eye, particularly in the retina and choroid. Zinc deficiency can alter vision, and severe deficiency causes changes in the retina and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Zinc interacts with taurine and vitamin A in the retina, modifies plasma membranes in the photoreceptors, regulates the light-rhodopsin reaction within the photoreceptor, modulates synaptic transmission, and serves as an antioxidant in both the RPE and retina. It seems to slow the progression of some degenerative retinal diseases (8621). Topically, zinc sulfate ophthalmic solution acts as a mild astringent, precipitating protein and clearing mucus from the outer surface of the eye (15).\n\nProstate cancer effects\n\nIn some clinical research, taking zinc in combination with other vitamins and minerals reduces the risk of prostate cancer (14135). Also, in laboratory research, zinc has been shown to inhibit prostate carcinoma cell growth (86909). However, other evidence, based on population research, suggests that zinc might adversely affect prostate cancer risk (10306, 15607). The reason for this discrepancy is not clear. It has been shown that zinc levels appear to decrease in the prostate tissue and prostatic fluid in men with prostatic carcinoma (6909, 6910). Also, laboratory research suggests that in malignant prostate cells, zinc up-regulated the expression of certain metallothionein (MT)-1 enzymes, as well as genes implicated in oncogenic pathways, such as Fos, Akt1, Jak3, and PI3K (87152). Laboratory research also suggests that zinc induced apoptosis (87490). Other potential mechanisms of action, as shown in laboratory research, include the role of zinc in the regulation of zinc transporters such as LIV-1 (ZUP6) (87267).\n\nSickle cell effects\n\nPeople with sickle cell disease (SCD) are commonly zinc deficient. Zinc deficiency in SCD might cause a cell-mediated immune disorder, and increase the risk of infection in SCD. Some researchers think zinc deficiency leads to increased production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin-1 (IL-1) which might result in vaso-occlusive pain. This may explain the benefit of zinc supplementation in some patients with SCD (8627).\n\nSkeletal effects\n\nThere is interest in using zinc for preventing osteoporosis. Zinc seems to be involved in the mineralization of bone. In animal models, zinc deficiency has been linked to abnormal bone formation. In humans, increased zinc content in bone appears to be associated with increased bone strength (14410). In people with osteoporosis, urinary zinc excretion is increased, possibly as a result of bone resorption (6918). Serum zinc levels and zinc intake seem to be lower in people with osteoporosis (6918, 6920, 14410). However, moderately high dietary zinc intake (53 mg per day) seems to increase magnesium excretion without affecting copper metabolism in postmenopausal adults (12424). Supplementation with high doses of zinc, 142 mg/day, also appears to decrease magnesium absorption and magnesium balance in healthy adult males (9624). This might adversely affect bone health. Zinc may compete with magnesium for ion exchange transport in the intestine (12424). More research on the clinical importance of these observations is needed.\n\nWilson disease\n\nWilson disease is a condition in which too much copper accumulates in vital organs, including the liver and brain. Zinc blocks copper absorption and increases copper elimination in the stool of people with Wilson disease (2692).\n\nWound-healing effects\n\nFor aiding in wound healing, topical zinc might enhance re-epithelialization and collagen synthesis, decrease inflammation, and inhibit bacterial growth (2699)."
